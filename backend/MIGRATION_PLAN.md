### Test Progress

1. Database Layer Testing
   - [x] Async engine creation
   - [x] Async session factory
   - [x] Session dependency
   - [x] Transaction management

2. Reddit Integration Testing
   - [x] AsyncPRAW client initialization
   - [x] Subreddit info retrieval
   - [x] Post retrieval
   - [x] Rate limiting handling
   - [x] Error handling
   - [x] Read-only mode verification

3. Service Layer Testing
   - [ ] Theme service
   - [ ] Audience service
   - [ ] Background task service

4. Background Tasks Testing
   - [ ] Task scheduling
   - [ ] Task execution
   - [ ] Error recovery
   - [ ] Progress tracking

5. API Layer Testing
   - [ ] Route handlers
   - [ ] Input validation
   - [ ] Response formatting
   - [ ] Error responses

6. Integration Testing
   - [ ] End-to-end flows
   - [ ] Data consistency
   - [ ] State management

7. Error Handling Testing
   - [ ] Expected errors
   - [ ] Unexpected errors
   - [ ] Recovery procedures

### Next Steps
1. Implement Theme service tests
2. Update Audience service for async operations
3. Test background task scheduling
4. Verify API endpoints with async handlers

### Notes
- Reddit service tests now fully passing with proper async mocking
- Database layer tests confirmed working
- Need to address Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings in models
