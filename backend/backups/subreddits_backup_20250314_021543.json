    "description": "##**What is Safe Haven?**\n\n**Safe Haven Foundation** is a decentralized B2B2C platform built on the VeChainThor blockchain which supports companies and blockchain projects, aiding their expansion within their verticals. We will open our platform and tech solutions to the community, developers, entrepreneurs, inheritance and trust professionals, and existing financial services companies.\n\nSafe Haven provides the **infrastructure, protocols, tools and technology** for individuals and companies to build on, in order to create their own crypto financial services and products. As a result, the patented Safe Haven Protocols can be adopted globally by service providers ranging from SMEs to global enterprises and as an extension by their millions of own end users.\n\n##**What we do:**\n\n- Asset Management\n- Financial Technology\n- Product Engineering\n\nTogether with our patented **Trust Alliance Network (TAN)**, an autonomous social networking hub for blockchain-related legal affairs, and the world\u2019s first legal reference for distributed ledger/blockchain applications, users and companies, Safe Haven will be able to provide digital inheritance, continuity and asset management services to crypto-asset owners.\n\nKey to the Safe Haven platform is the **SHA token**, a VIP-180 token that will have a purpose in all of Safe Haven\u2019s solutions. SHA will be used as fuel for smart contracts and can be locked to gain access to Safe Haven solutions. Safe Haven will also have Masternodes, which will be integral to our Governance Model.\n\n *Through Safe Haven, we envision a future where everyone can easily create plans to manage and distribute their crypto assets, digital inheritance and business continuity to their partners and loved ones.*\n\n###**Links & Resources**\n1.

    "description": "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*.\n\nIf you are new to Bitcoin, check out [We Use Coins](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/) and [Bitcoin.org](https://www.bitcoin.org/).

    "description": "*Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It\u2019s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\u2019s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

Only In-Depth Discussions\n* Discussion posts should be based on interesting or novel topics that are conversation starters.

    "description": "Some basic rules:\n\n1. Please don't post here if you aren't yet 30 - we will be removing posts from people under 30. r/SkincareAddiction has a fantastic list of the other subs on Reddit where you will be talking to your peers: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/related_subs\n\n2. We can't (and don't) offer medical advice. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your health. Your post will be removed for asking about medical conditions (for example: a photo and \"What is this?)\n\n3. No spam, self-promotion, direct product links or consumer surveys! If you would like to recommend a product, you may link it within a text post. Also, do not self-promote your app, blog, you tube reviews, cosmetic services etc. Please don't use this group for surveys or consumer research.  If you are doing academic research and would like to ask for permission to post about your study, YOU MUST contact the moderation team before doing so.\n\n4. Discussion of cosmetic surgeries / enhancements / treatments is totally cool here. \n\n5. Selfies are not allowed EXCEPT on Selfie Sundays.  If you are posting to ask questions about a particular area of your face, you must edit your photo so it is clear what you are concerned about, either by cropping the photo or by blocking out features you are NOT asking about.  \n\n6. Be nice. Constructive criticism is cool, but acting like an ass is not. And do NOT post things like \"How old do you think I look / am\" as that never goes well. \n\n7. If you are shilling for a MLM company, you will be banned. Please see r/antiMLM if you want to know why.\n\n8. [Wear sunscreen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI&t=118)\n\nWe recommend checking out the [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction) over at /r/SkincareAddiction for a comprehensive list of skincare FAQs, tutorials, and their excellent [skincare Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index). The folks at ScA have put in a ton of time and effort into their resources, so take advantage of them!",

If your post/comment isn\u2019t showing up, it\u2019s probably because your account is too new.\n1.

    "description": "**About**\n\nWarhammer 40k is a franchise created by Games Workshop, detailing the far future and the grim darkness it holds.

    "description": "#Cryptography \n... is the art of creating mathematical / information theoretic assurances for who can do what with data, including but not limited to the classical example of encrypting messages so that only the key-holder can read it. Cryptography lives at an intersection of [math](/r/math) and [computer science](/r/compsci).\n\nThis subreddit is intended for links and discussions surrounding the theory and practice of modern and *strong* cryptography.\n\n**Please note that this subreddit focused on the tech, not politics!** The focus is on the algorithms and the security of the implementations. \n\n---\n\n####**Want to join?**\nBecause this subreddit currently is in restricted mode, you will NOT be able to post or comment before your account has been approved. Send us a reason for why you want to join via mod mail, click here and tell us why you want to discuss cryptography;  \n\n###[Click HERE to send a request to join](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/crypto&subject=Joining&message=I%20want%20to%20join%20the%20cryptography%20forum%20becase%20%5Binsert%20what%20you%20want%20to%20post%20or%20ask%20about%20here%5D%0A%0AI%20have%20read%20and%20understood%20the%20rules%2C%20and%20I%20promise%20that%20will%20stick%20to%20the%20topic%20of%20cryptography%20and%20computer%20security%0A%0AI%20understand%20that%20not%20filling%20out%20a%20reason%2C%20or%20giving%20a%20reason%20that%20is%20not%20on%20topic%20for%20the%20forum%2C%20will%20mean%20I%20will%20not%20be%20approved.)\n\n---\n\n#####NOTE: This is NOT a cryptocurrency subreddit, [see /r/cryptocurrency](/r/cryptocurrency)\n\n---\n\n###RULES \n(along with normal [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette))\n\nDon't forget to read our [**RULES PAGE**](/r/crypto/about/rules/)! The rules listed there are also used as this sub's report reasons. The quick version;\n\n* Assume good faith and be kind. This is a friendly subreddit.\n* Using any AI / LLM without disclosing it is prohibited. You MUST inform us if you used one, AND share the prompt. They are frequently wrong and we must be able to distinguish the true source\n* Codes, simple ciphers, ARGs, and other such \"weak crypto\" don't belong here. (Rule of thumb: If a desktop computer can break a code in less than an hour, it's not strong crypto.) You're probably looking for /r/codes.\n* Do not ask people to break your cryptosystem without first sharing the algorithm. [Sharing just the output is like...](/r/crypto/comments/1boxkg/-/c98x4ej)\n* \"Crack this cipher\" challenges also belong in /r/codes *unless* they're based on interesting crypto implementation bugs, e.g. weak RSA keys.\n* Familiarize yourself with the following before posting a question about a novel cryptosystem, or else the risk is nobody will take their time to answer: \n  * [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)\n  * [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html)\n* Don't use this sub to cheat on competitions or challenges! You're expected to solve such problems yourself. You may ask for help to understand it, but you should disclose the source. \n* Systems that *use* crypto are not necessarily relevant here, e.g. Bitcoin. Maybe try /r/cryptocurrency? Political news also very rarely belong here. See the list of related subs below for alternatives. Remember that this sub is focused on the algorithms, and isn't political. \n\n---\n\n###RESOURCES \n\nInternal:\n\n* [Our wiki pages](/r/crypto/wiki)  \n* Threads on starting in crypto [one](/r/crypto/comments/hnze6) & [two](/r/crypto/comments/3izwdo)\n* Thread of [crypto links](/r/crypto/comments/2jw4yo) - [older thread](/r/crypto/comments/ih1z3)\n* Our [monthly cryptography wishlist threads!](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/search?q=wishlist+thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new) \n* Our [hiring threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/search?q=Hiring+thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new) \n\nExternal:\n\n* [Lemmy cryptography forum - affiliated](https://infosec.pub/c/crypto)\n* [Cryptology ePrint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/) \n* [Discussion site for ePrint papers](https://askcryp.to/) \n* [Libera Chat's IRC:s #crypto](https://web.libera.chat/?nick=redditor?#crypto) - ([IRC protocol URL](irc://irc.libera.chat/%23crypto)\\) \n* [Metzdowd cryptography mailing list](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/) \n* [Randombit cryptography mailing list](https://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/)\n* [StackExchange cryptography community](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/) \n\n**Other subreddits that may be of interest:**\n\nRelated:\n\n* /r/cryptography \n* /r/encryption \n* /r/weboftrust (fairly empty)\n* /r/capabilities - A type of security model\n* /r/Intelligence - Espionage\n\nTheory:\n\n* /r/algorithms\n* /r/mathematics, /r/math\n\nPractical:\n\n* /r/netsec - Network Security\n* /r/RNG - Randomness generation\n* /r/compsec - Local computer security\n* /r/websec - Security in the browser\n* /r/security - General security subreddit \n* /r/privacy - General privacy subreddit \n* /r/compsci & /r/ComputerScience - Development and application of algorithms \n\nEducational, hobbyist:\n\n* /r/codes & /r/breakmycode - For cracking basic codes\n* /r/gpgpractice - Learn to use GPG here\n* /r/primitiveplayground - test your homebrew ciphers here\n* /r/stanfordcrypto\n\nPolitical and in the news:\n\n* /r/privacypatriots/\n* /r/NSAleaks - Snowden documents and more \n* /r/restorethefourth\n\nSoftware:\n\n* /r/gpg (fairly empty)\n* /r/bitcoin, /r/cryptocurrency - crypto applied to money\n\nMemes and low effort submissions:\n\n* /r/shittycrypto\n\n---\n\nFeel free to message the moderators with suggestions for how to improve this subreddit, as well as for requesting adding links in the sidebar.",

Most things posted are exaggerations of a Muslim's day to day life.\n\n>#Discord /r/Izlam Server \n\n> Join your brozers and sizters in our Izlam discord server for quality memes and jokes. https://discord.gg/Uta5eH8w4h\n### [](#h3-Blue)\n\n#####[](#h5-yellow)\n>#RULES:\n\n>**1. Be Civil:** This is a Muslim run subreddit, maintain good adab (manners/character). Don't swear. Treat everyone well, Muslim or otherwise. \n\n>**2. All Posts Must Be Islam Related:** Just because something is funny doesn't necessarily make it Islam-related. Additionally, Arabic =/= Islamic. Memes about parents being strict =/= Islamic. Islam and culture are very different things. So much so that if your post implies that \"white people\" can't be or are not Muslim, then it will be removed.\n\n>**3. No rebosts:** It is disliked to repost memes on this subreddit especially if your intention is to milk some karma out of it. Reposting for the sake of the meta is a different issue which the mods will have to decide whether to keep up the post or not.\n\n>**4. No Screenshots from MEMRI TV:** Without this rule, we get flooded with their posts.\n\n>**5. No NSFW Content:** This is not a NSFW subreddit, so think real hard before posting anything inappropriate. Most, if not all, get removed, and you will be permanently banned.\n\n>**6. No Shia/Sunni/other hate:** There's a difference between satire and insults and some jokes placed find themselves entering a realm of hate for certain beliefs in Islam. Whether you're Muslim or not, this sub is not meant to be antagonistic to Muslims, so any posts or comments that seem to attack Muslims will be removed and put the user at the risk of a ban. This includes beliefs that you don't agree with. \n\n>**7. No Blasphemy:** In efforts to remain a halal form of humor, we are not allowing blasphemy on this sub.\n\n>Mocking God - ban\n\n>Mocking His prophets - ban\n\n>Mocking His book - ban\n\n>Mocking the angels - ban\n\n>Mocking Islam - ban\n\n>Facetious remarks regarding these could lead to a BAN\n\n>Simply depicting these things could lead to a BAN\n\n>Note: although depicting shaytan and jinn is not classified as blasphemy, we will also be removing posts including depictions of them\n\n>**8. Translate everything you post:** If you post something in Arabic, llama, or any language, always translate it to English. We have a number of members of this sub that would enjoy your content, but simply don't understand it. Not following this rule makes your post subject to removal.\n\n\n>**9. No Debating!** This is hardly the place for a real debate about Islamic jurisprudence. Or anything, really. Too many people are trolling for you to get any accurate information from most posters here. We recommend heading to /r/islam or /r/Shia if you have questions pertaining to actual Islam. Even inciting a debate could potentially lead to a ban. Don't debate.\n\n>**10. No Identifying Info Posts or Brigading:** Don't target any subs and downvote or otherwise attack them for whatever reason. When posting to other subs, either cross-post or create a no participation post. If anyone's username is in a submission that could potentially lead to this sub upvoting or downvoting them en masse, the post will be removed. This applies to any form of social media or post. Always block out identifying information, whether it's a real name or username.\n\n\n#### [](#h4-green)\n>##[Giving dawah to:](#icon-check)\n\n>/r/islam \n\n>/r/MuslimLounge \n\n>/r/Muslim\n\n>/r/IslamicQuotes\n\n>r/MuslimFamilySolutions\n\n>/r/Muslim \n\n######[New comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Izlam/comments/) ~~|~~ [About /r/Izlam](http://redd.it/2f4d94) ~~|~~",

    "description": "###### **WEEKLY THREADS** | [What We've Been Reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/o3mine/what_have_you_read_this_week_and_what_do_you/)\n\n###[DARK MODE](http://dm.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations)\n###[NORMAL THEME](http://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations)\n\n##What is NovelTranslations for?\n\n* **The main purpose of this subreddit is to be a place to have discussions, and ask questions about things related to translated or written webnovels. If your post doesn't directly have anything to do with those two categories, it could possibly get removed. Misleading or clickbait titles, troll posts, or shitposts are subject to removal. Use the filters if you don't want to see a certain kind of post. If you are unsure whether or not your post will get removed, please message the mods and we will try to answer as soon as possible.**\n\n##Subreddit Rules\n\n1\\. **Discussion is the goal** - All posts must be directly novel related, informative, and discussion focused. This can be about a scene from a web novel you particularly liked/disliked, the novel as a whole, or issues related to the community.\n\n2\\. **Recommendation Requests** - Requests for personalized recommendations or suggestions are not allowed. Post instead to our Weekly Recommendation Thread (stickied at the top of the 'HOT' page and also accessible through the subreddit's nav menu or through the buttons on the sidebar widget )\n\nPosts asking users to list their favorite/the best book of a genre, style, etc that don't include an answer and why in the body will be assumed to be recommendation requests and removed.\n\n3\\. **Don't be an asshole** - We understand that many of you are angry about your generally pathetic lives. Do not bring that into the subreddit or the community. Do not enter a discussion with the intent to \"prove\" that you are the superior being. None of you are. Just be chill.\n\n\n4\\. **Toxic Reader Behavior** - The wonderful web novels that we talk about and share with each other here are translated and produced through the hard work of REAL PEOPLE. The translators and editors who work on these novels spend hours of the their free time translating these novels for you guys. Do not be assholes, or we won't have any novels to read.\n\nComments like: \"Translation too slow\" when chapters release several times a week or \"I only read after 200+ chapters\" will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n\n5\\. **No Platform-based Hate.** - This subreddit is for discussion on web novels and their intrinsic qualities. Not about the platform they are posted on, the various business dealings of the players in the industry or any thing of that nature. How other people conduct their business and relationships is of no consequence here. Do not attempt to create drama regarding platforms. Do not promote hate for a novel based on where it's published.\n\nOne warning. Any violations of this rule after that will result in a ban.\n \n6\\. **Do Not Post Links To Aggregators** - Many of the web novels here are made freely available to everyone to read. Aggregators steal free content to make advertising revenue. Do not send people to read on an aggregator website. Do not recommend an aggregator website. Use NovelUpdates to find the official source for any web novel.\n\nShould the novel be paywalled, do not recommend an aggregator. We do not stand for or encourage piracy on this subreddit.\n\nThis is a zero tolerance rule. All offenders will be banned. No ignorance excuse.\n\n7\\. **Spoilers** - If you do not mark your post or comment as having spoilers it will be removed. Any posts with a spoiler in the title will be removed.\n\nSpoiler tags in comments are done like the example below if you are using markdown or use the built-in spoiler tags on the redesign.\n\nHow to spoiler tag: >(#)!spoiler here!(#)< remove the (#) and this appears as <!spoiler here!>.\n\n8\\. **Inappropriate Content** - This isn't a NSFW subreddit. Don't post that stuff here. Posts will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banne\n\n###[Message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnoveltranslations)\n\n##Wiki\n\n* **Our wiki contains additional details and other random things.

Common beliefs identified by [Eliade](https://www.singingtotheplants.com/2007/12/eliades-shamanism/) are the following:\n\n* Spirits exist and they play important roles both in individual lives and in human society.\n* The Shaman can communicate with the spirit world.\n* Spirits can be benevolent or malevolent.\n* The Shaman can treat sickness caused by malevolent spirits.\n* The Shaman can employ trance inducing techniques to incite visionary ecstasy and go on vision quests.\n* The Shaman's spirit can leave the body to enter the supernatural world to search for answers.\n* The Shaman evokes animal images as spirit guides, omens, and message-bearers.\n* The Shaman can perform other varied forms of divination, scry, throw bones/runes, and sometimes foretell of future events.\n\n---\n\n* /r/AcademicReligion_Myth\n* /r/AncientCulture_Acadmc\n* /r/AncientHistory\n* /r/AncientKnowledge\n* /r/AncientMigrations\n* /r/AncientWorld\n* /r/Animism\n* /r/Anthropology\n* /r/AskaHeathen  \n* /r/AstralProjection  \n* r/castaneda  \n* r/DMT  \n* r/Dreams  \n* /r/Druidism  \n* r/energy_work\n* /r/Foraging\n* /r/Heathenry\n* /r/HerbLore\n* /r/Norse\n* /r/Pagan\n* /r/Paganacht\n* /r/Paganism\n* /r/Paleoanthropology  \n* r/Psychonaut  \n* r/shroomers  \n* /r/Wicca",

They also use a lot of time looking for security holes in existing protocols to make sure they can still be trusted. This is called *cryptanalysis*.\n\nIf you want a formal introduction to cryptography, you should read [An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.182.9999).

Homework questions that fail to meet these requirements will be removed.\n\n  1. **Be Respectful**\n  \n  Shakespeare may have been a master at murdering people with words, but as the late, great Chadwick Boseman said, \"We don't do that here.\"  Keep it civil, please.\n\n  1. **There Is No Authorship Question**\n\n  There are a number of other subs that discuss the various theories that someone other than the man from Stratford wrote the works attributed to William Shakespeare.

This cuts down on blogspam, as well as broken links from small webservers that can't handle the traffic. News articles about Shakira are still okay to submit.\n\n* Please avoid creepy titles. Examples of bad titles: \"Dat ass\", \"What a sexy body\", \"O Face\". Examples of good titles: \"At The [Awards Show]\", \"On the set of [Video Title]\".\n\n* Blatant reposts (of images that are still on the front page, for example) will be removed without warning.\n\n\n#About\n***\nShakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, known professionally as Shakira, was Born and raised in Barranquilla and is a Colombian singer-songwriter, dancer, record producer, choreographer and model. Shakira is known to have adopted many genres, including folk, mainstream pop and rock and has released a total of 11 albums and 4 live albums becoming the highest-selling Colombian artist of all time, having sold a total of 125 million records worldwide, over 70 million albums and 55 million singles.\n\nShakira has won many awards including five MTV Video Music Awards, two Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, twenty-eight Billboard Latin Music Awards and has been Golden Globe-nominated and she also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nOutside of her work in the music industry, Shakira is also involved in philanthropic activities through charity work and benefit concerts, notably her Pies Descalzos Foundation, her performance at the \"Clinton Global Initiative\" created by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and her invitation to the Oval Office by President Barack Obama in February 2010 to discuss early childhood development.\n\n**Submitting music videos and discussion about her music, life, tours or anything Shakira is encouraged!**",

    "description": "# SETTING UP SHAP-E\n\nThe easiest way to try out Shap-E is through [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/Shap-E). Huggingface is a very simple web UI. Just type your prompt and click generate. The downside to huggingface is that you cannot download the models. You also cannot generate multiple models in one batch.\n\nAnother easy way to access this code is through the [Shap-E Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XvXBALiOwAT5-OaAD7AygqBXFqTijrVf?usp=sharing&authuser=3#scrollTo=Ye90kA6KeYjB). Colab is a virtual Python environment, which means that the code runs on a server instead of your machine. The advantage of this is that you can just click \"Run\" with little to no setup. **It will also run on a phone.** Just scroll to the line that says prompt = \"a sword\" and change a sword to whatever you want. When you're done, you can even download your models through the file interface.\n\nFinally, here is the [Official Shap-E Github Repository](https://github.com/openai/shap-e). As Shap-E is a completely open source project, you can find everything that goes into the project here.\n\n***DOWNLOADING MODELS***\n\nThe easiest way to create models you can download and use is through the Google Colab option. The final section of code in that project writes each mesh generated into a .ply file (plot cloud). \n\nTo download these plot cloud files from the virtual machine, first open the Colab File interface by clicking 'files'\nhttps://prnt.sc/W0U1w_IcThJL\n\nOnce you've done that, open the folder named shap-e by clicking the dropdown arrow next to it.\nhttps://prnt.sc/9rCOR2ikxqHz\n\nThe inside of that folder should look like this. Your models are named as example_mesh followed by a number by default. They are the highlighted files in the following screenshot\nhttps://prnt.sc/2jDoTnq_H4Ap\n\nOnce you have downloaded the files, you are ready to begin manipulating them in other software\n\n# BRINGING MODELS TO BLENDER\n\nI will be explaining Blender as it is my free 3D Modelling software of choice. Before we can import models to Blender, we have to ensure the Plot Cloud add-on is installed. This short video explains that quickly. Once you've done that, you can simply File > Import > .ply > and select your file\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y2UzSKBgSo\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you bring your model into Blender is that it has no colors. While the Shap-E model had a colorful texture, your model in Blender is completely gray. To fix this, find the dropdown in the top left corner that says \"Object Mode\" and change it to Vertex Paint.\nhttps://prnt.sc/nVybFfMpctXO\nhttps://prnt.sc/VLxN8f4rSyHF\n\nFrom there, you can do whatever you like with your model. You can even use Blender's painting features to edit the material on your model.\n\nAnd, speaking of editing your model, you can do that too! To edit the polygons of your model, just change to Edit Mode. You can reposition and resize points, lines, faces, or entire polygons with simple mouse movements. You can also change to Sculpt Mode to edit the shape of each polygon.\n\n#  BRINGING MODELS TO A GAME ENGINE\n\nIf you've tried to bring your models into your favorite game engine, you were probably disappointed to discover that softwares like Unity and Unreal do not support the plot cloud format natively. This is why it's important to bring our models into blender: so that we can export them in .fbx format.\n\nYou can pretty much just Import to Blender > Export as fbx. Although, it's always good to touch up your models with Blender's editing tools.\n\nOnce you bring them into your game engine, you will likely find that the model looks messed up. This is because Blender FBX exports include a camera and a light source as children of your object. You can easily delete those components to fix this.\n\nYou may also find your model has no colors. (At least, that was my experience in Unity). The reason for this is that most game engines use a default shader that does not load vertex colors to save resources. I will walk through how to fix this in Unity (because at the time of writing I have no experience in unreal :D). \n\nTo fix the problem, you need to great a Shader Graph. Although you've probably never had to do this before, it's actually really easy. Just make sure that you're using a Unity version later than 2021.2 if you want to use the built-in render pipeline.\n\nThe first step is to grab the official Shader Graph package from Unity in the package manager. Go to Window > Package Manager and install Shadergraph.\n\nNow head over to the Project panel (it's the one that has your Assets folder). Click Create and find the Shader Graph option. When you hover it, there will be a list of options. The top option should be the renderer that you are currently using. So for me, it's BuiltIn. You want to do Shader Graph > BuiltIn and click Lit Shader Graph. \n\nAlmost done! Click on your new shader graph and look into the Inspector panel. Click on \"Open Shader Editor\". Right Click on the background area of the Shader Editor and click Create Node. Now click the search bar that comes up and type \"Vertex Color\". Double click the Vertex Color option. The node that is created should have one output named Out(4). Click and drag that dot to the one that says \"Base Color\" underneath Fragment. Then in the top left corner, click \"Save Asset\".\n\nFinally, back in your project, you need to create a new material. Click your new material and look in the inspector. At the very top, click the drop down next to Shader. Click the \"Shader Graphs\" option, and then click your shader graph.\n\nNow all you need to do is apply this material to any models you import to Unity.",

Content should be related to shapez.io**\n\nComments are partially exempt: They should be related to their parent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2. Keep it PG-13**\n\nThis is just a game about making shapes, after all. (See https://www.marshallcinema.com/mpaa#:~:text=PG%2D13Parents%20Strongly%20Cautioned,not%20be%20suited%20for%20them for exact guidelines; just replace motion picture with whatever it is being directed to.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3. No harassment or toxicity**\n\nDo not target any individual user or group of users in a negative manner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4. Do not troll or spam**\n\nAvoid intentionally upsetting others or posting unwanted content in bulk.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**5. Avoid reposts**\n\nIf a question, issue, or suggestion has been posted about before, do not post the same exact thing again! Only make a new post if you can meaningfully add to the previous post, or if yours is distinctly different.\n\nA repost will be removed if the original post is less than a week old. Posts about something that you created are exempt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**6. Content that shows how to create a floating layer must be marked as a spoiler**\n\nAn example would be the small square in the level 20 logo shape or the upper part of the level 26 compass shape. Images simply showing a shape itself or transportation of a shape, along with images taken in map mode, are exempt from this rule.\n\nThis is a less serious rule, so instead of an immediate post takedown, you will be given a 30 day warning. If you violate this rule again before the warning expires, the new post will be taken down and the warning will be refreshed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**7. Follow the Reddiquette**\n\nSmall violations can be excused, but larger or more frequent violations will not.\n\nSee https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette for the full Reddiquette.",

Rudeness is unacceptable. \n\n**Please read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) and [the requirements for each type of post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/requirements) before submitting.**\n\n## Rules  \n\n- **1. All submissions must be original.**    \nEverything offered in /r/Showerthoughts must be written by its poster. AI-generated content, copied-and-pasted content, and other such unoriginal content is strictly forbidden.\n\n- **2. All posts must meet [the minimum requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/requirements) for their flair.**     \nIncorrectly flaired posts will be removed. **Very few posts will be showerthoughts.**\n\n- **3. Your entire thought must be in the title.**     \nPosts in /r/Showerthoughts must stand on their own. Explanations, elaboration, examples, or clarifications should only be offered as comments.\n\n- **4. Submissions must be offered in error-free English.**    \nSince posts in /r/Showerthoughts are rarely longer than a sentence, they must meet a minimum standard of quality.\n\n- **5. No misinformation.**     \nMisinformation of any kind is forbidden. This includes posts that use blatantly false premises to attract attention.\n\n- **6. No done-to-death or banned posts.**      \nPosts may not be jokes, puns, wordplay, advice, soapboxing, or \"shower commentary\" (like \"Ow, this water is too hot!\"). Posts pertaining to politics, religion, Reddit, and social justice are also forbidden, as are posts about or pertaining to language.\n\n- **7. No spam or spam-enabling activity of any kind.**    \nSpam and spam-enabling activity is strictly prohibited, regardless of how or where on Reddit it takes place. **Users may only offer one post per seventy-two-hour period.**\n\n- **8. Remain civil at all times.**      \nBigotry, hate-speech, harassment, and personal attacks will result in immediate and permanent bans. Submissions which are hostile, intentionally demeaning, or directly insulting will be removed.\n\n> [**Please see the complete rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules)\n\n## CSS\n\nThe /r/Showerthoughts logo and subreddit design were created by **/u/m_gartsman**  \n\nCSS by **/u/qtx** \n\n## Subreddits you may like:\n\nColumn A | Column B | Column B\n:--------:|:---------|:---------\n |/r/nostupidquestions|/r/map_porn\n |/r/shittyideas|/r/woahdude\n |/r/lightbulb|/r/isitbullshit\n |/r/baww|/r/rant\n |/r/markmywords|/r/ImitationZen\n |/r/theoryofreddit|/r/anger\n |/r/outoftheloop|/r/self\n |/r/crazyideas|/r/casualconversation\n |/r/oneliners",

If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

    "description": "###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!\nHere you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n* **No watermarks:**  We do not allow any images or videos that contain a watermark of a product or a username. These include TikTok videos and Instagram videos.\n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general.

    "description": "###There is no such thing as a Stupid Question!\n\nDon't be embarrassed of your curiosity; everyone has questions that they may feel uncomfortable asking certain people, so this place gives you a nice area not to be judged about asking it. Everyone here is willing to help. All questions are welcome such as to how to change oil, to how to tie shoes. All questions are welcome - except clear trolls, please don't be that guy. Thanks for reading all of this, even if you didn't read all of this, and your eye started somewhere else have a cookie.\n\n---\n\n**Related subreddits:**\n\n- /r/findareddit \n\n- /r/NewToReddit \n\n- /r/DoesAnybodyElse \n\n- /r/WDP (Why do people...)\n\n- /r/OutOfTheLoop (check their rules before posting)\n\n- /r/explainlikeimfive (check their rules before posting)\n\n- /r/TooAfraidToAsk\n\n- /r/myfriendwantstoknow \n\n- /r/morbidquestions\n\n- /r/tipofmytongue \n\n- /r/whatissnoodoing\n\n- /r/ExplainBothSides \n\n- /r/ChangeMyView\n\n- /r/PeopleWhoWorkAt\n\n- /r/SampleSize\n\n- /r/PollQuestions\n\n---\n\nThis subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.\n\n#RULES:\n\n# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine human-written attempt at an answer.\n\nAll direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed. (Link only responses are permitted if they are asking for a subreddit.)\n\nDo not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should \"google it.\" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself.\n\n#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question\n\nTry to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).\n\n#Rule 3: Be Nice\n\nFollow Reddiquette:  Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.\n\n#Rule 4: No medical advice questions\n\nNo medical advice questions\n\nA rule of thumb would be: Could this question or its answers make someone decide not to go see a doctor when they really should?\n\nIf you are asking here to avoid bothering a doctor, you probably should bother a doctor.\n\n#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions\n\nDisallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. \n\n#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions\n\nSuicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.\n\n#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging\n\nNo trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. \n\nAsking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. \n\nNo questions trying to elicit participation without learning anything of substance from the answers.\n\n#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter\n\nNothing like \"Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?\" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.\n\nTasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics\n\nQuestions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.\n\nWe are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large. We reserve the right to make judgement calls on when a particular thread becomes disruptive to the sub, and we are unable to maintain a civil space for the discussion.",

    "description": "***\n**Welcome to /r/nails! For anything and everything to do with nails and nail care!**\n***\nNail Care Series (In Progress):\n\n* [Intro To Basic Nail Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nails/comments/3g3832/introduction_to_basic_nail_tools_for_beginners/)\n\n____\n\n## Rule 1: Be civil and respectful.\n\n> There is a zero-tolerance policy on anything that can be perceived as bullying, harassment, ridiculing, trolling, or any actions that target an individual in a negative way. This is a place of appreciation for others artwork, so please keep that in mind at all times. \n\n## Rule 2: No NSFW content.\n\n> Keep images, comments and links work/age appropriate. Anything explicit, graphic, or sexual will be removed. Any photos that depict dangerous, risky or illicit activity is also against the rules (for example: drug use, self harm, using a cellphone while driving, etc).\n\n## Rule 3: Flair your posts! \n\n> Flairs serve as a way to let users know what your post is about. We do not remove posts that aren\u2019t flared, but the flairs are what our search function relies upon, so we ask that you please assign them to your posts.  \n\n## Rule 4: Credit the work of others. \n\n>   If the picture or content you are posting is NOT your own, you are required to credit the artist or acknowledge that it\u2019s not yours, either within the post\u2019s title or in a comment. You will receive a warning before being banned, if we suspect you are stealing others art. PLEASE REPORT MISCONDUCT.\n\n## Rule 5: Stay on topic. \n\n> All posts must be related to nails (the kind that grow on your hands and feet)! Comments should contribute to the conversation and not derail the discussion.\n\n## Rule 6: No advertising.\n\n> Self-promotional content (this includes but is not limited to Youtube \u201ctrend\u201d & \u201ctutorial\u201d videos, surveys, well as blog posts) are not permitted to be posted without mod approval.  If you do not follow Reddit's rules for [self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and [spam](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499), your post will be removed and you will likely be banned. Your account history will be taken into consideration when concluding if you are a spammer or not. Moderators will use their own discretion to decide. Keep the following quote in mind: ***\u201dIt\u2019s ok to be a Reddit account with a website, but it\u2019s not ok to be a website with a Reddit account\u201d***\n\n## Rule 7: No trolling and/or spamming. \n\n> Report anything that you feel violates the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n## Rule 8: No distributing personal information.\n\n> This includes name, address, phone number, gender, age, location or links to websites that provide that information like Facebook. Applies to sharing the private information of people aside from yourself as well. **Small watermarks are OKAY, however we ask that you do NOT include them in your post titles.  In an effort to limit self-promotional content, we are asking users to avoid sharing Instagram/social media handles as post titles. Instead, our users now have the option to customize their [User Flair](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/article_attachments/360008300952/Screen_Shot_2018-07-30_at_2.54.33_AM.png).** On r/Nails, you can select and edit your own flair. To do so, log in using the desktop version of Reddit.com, look for where it says \u201cEdit Flair\u201d in the sidebar to the right. This button should be located just under our subscriber count. Click on it for a list of images for you to select from. In order to create your own flair, choose \u201c[CUSTOM]\u201d, and then enter something into the text box (Example \u2014 \u201cIG: @nails\u201d). Click 'Save' to finish.\n\n## Rule 9: No hate speech or suggestive comment making.\n\n> This includes but is not limited to racism, sexism and/or homophobia. And because this apparently still isn't clear enough, insulting and personally attacking other users or making unwanted sexual comments is grounds for an immediate ban. \n\n## Rule 10: No politics.\n\n> No political posts, political keywords, or political debates.\n\n\n___\n\n#**Related Subreddits:**\n\n###**Nails**\n* /r/RedditLaqueristas \n* /r/NailArt \n* /r/SoakOff \n* /r/MalePolish \n* /r/RandomActsOfPolish\n\n\n###**Professionals**\n* /r/Cosmetology \n* /r/LicensedForBeauty\n\n\n###**Other/Beauty**\n* /r/MakeupAddiction\n* /r/MakeupRehab\n* /r/Beauty\n* /r/SkincareAddiction\n* /r/AsianBeauty\n* /r/HaircareScience\n* /r/FancyFollicles\n* /r/Hair\n\n___",

    "description": "#Welcome to r/RedditLaqueristas!\n\n\n### Join us\nCome chat with us on [Discord!](https://discord.gg/redditlaqueristas)\n---\n\n### RULES\n\n### 1. Be nice.\n\nBe kind with constructive criticism; don't comment anything that is needlessly rude or hurtful. Our community is built around supporting and appreciating nail art, no matter the artist's current skill level.\n\nCritiques or comments including harassment, slurs, and -isms are not allowed. Engaging in the same type of behavior in retaliation is also not acceptable. Report inflammatory comments.\n\n### 2. Content must relate to nails.\n\nThis subreddit is about nails: your nails, others' nails, nail art, nail care, nail issues, nail progress, nail product reviews, tutorials, etc. **Not nail related posts are not allowed.**\n\n### 3. Credit the source of your content.\n\nIf a pic you post isn't your own, you must use the ~Inspo~ post tag AND either credit the original artist or specify you don't know who the original artist is. Please cite the source of your reference and credit the original artists, including a link to the original source if possible.\n\nCross-posting from other subreddits is allowed as long as the content follows these rules - rule #4 applies here and a list of polishes and products must be included in the cross post (please do not direct us to the main post). \n\n### 4. List polishes and products used.\n\nInclude a list of polishes and products used with your post. **Posts without lists will be removed after 12 hours.** Include the products in the post title, text body, or a separate comment after posting. Brand names *and* shade names/numbers are required.\n\nProduct list should detail each of the main items used; for example, if you used a collection of polishes, each polish should be named. Base and top coat is not necessary to list, but helpful. Number of coats is also helpful, as is spelling out the name of the brand rather than using an acronym.\n\n* In the title -> **Polish Brand - Polish Name**\n\n* In the description or as a comment below your post -> **\u201cThis is Polish Brand \u2018Polish Name\u2019 in two coats.\u201d**\n\nIf you are a professional nail technician posting your own work, a product list is still required.\n\nIf your nails were done by someone else or at a salon, describe what you had done best to your ability and tag the post as \u201cSalon Work.\u201d\n\n### 5. ADs must be clearly tagged [FTC].\n\nSponsored posts* and ADs must be clearly tagged using the appropriate subreddit **POST FLAIR** (listed below) and your relationship with the brand must be explained (**USER FLAIR**). This is required by the FTC (see: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers).\n\n*Subreddits, including their mods and users, are required to abide by the rules of Reddit TOS, and Reddit communities fall under American Consumer Protection rules; as such, this is the law. Mods will intervene for posts that fail to make their relationship or sponsor with a brand clear to the community. Mods will add the AD tag to posts that appear to fall under these guidelines, and will remove posts that fail to update their posts for clarity.*\n\n*Sponsored Posts are considered **advertisements** (ADs) - sponsored means paid or compensated to post. Any content featuring an item that was given in turn or with compensation is considered an AD. In the nail polish world, the \u201cPR\u201d tag is often used to denote sponsored content - \u201cPR\u201d stands for \u201cpublic relations\u201d or \u201cpress release\u201d, thus the item or content becomes a \u201cPR product.\u201d The FTC guidelines say to be specific and avoid jargon, so we are adding \u201cAD\u201d to all sponsored flairs and any post that falls into the following categories for clarity.\n\n**POST FLAIR:** We require flair on all user posts\u2019 and sponsored posts must be tagged appropriately using the flair options listed below.\nPosters should also clarify sponsorship details in text when posting, such as whether the product was given freely, a prototype gift, paid content, and so forth. \n\n*    MAKER PR (AD) - When you are the brand sharing about your product and gain monetary benefits from exposure. This includes nail polish brand owners, nail technicians selling sets, small businesses, Etsy shop owners, etc.\n*    PAID PR (AD) - When a brand pays you to post (\"paid PR product\"). \n\n    USE THE REDDIT BRAND AFFILIATE TOGGLE WHEN POSTING\n    Need help? https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/23972085214484-What-s-a-brand-affiliate-tag\n\n*    GIFTED PR (AD) - When a brand gives a person an item (\"gifted PR product\") and that item is used and reviewed and shared publicly.\n*   SELF-PROMO (AD) - You are an influencer, such as a nail technician, sharing your work, but you do not gain direct monetary benefits from exposure.\n\n**USER FLAIR:** Blogger, Swatcher, and Brand Owner user flair tags are available to make your brand relationship very clear. You can change your user flair on the subreddit sidebar, by your username.\n\nNote: **Affiliate links are *not allowed*.** Posts for deals/discounts/and sales on behalf of a brand or as a brand must also be tagged as AD. By nature, these are advertisements and must be tagged as such.\n\n### 6. No explicit/pedi posts, this is a SFW subreddit.\n\nAppreciate nails/nail art WITHOUT mentioning explicit, graphic, or sexual terms. Referring to things as hot, sexy, etc. is not allowed. Please report any explicit or harassing behavior that you see in this subreddit.\n\n-\n\nPedi posts are allowed on DISCORD ONLY; POSTS HERE WILL BE REMOVED AND REDIRECTED. http://discord.gg/redditlaqueristas\n\n    Pedis are level-locked on our Discord; users must participate in order to \u201cgain XP\u201d (karma) before they can post pedi pics. There is too much of a communal risk to allow pedi pics openly on our subreddit.\n\n-\n\nUse cannabis and paint your nails? Come on over to our companion subreddit, /r/laquerENTstas\n\n### 7. No injury posts; no medical advice.\n\nNo injury posting. Bare and broken nails (both together) must be spoilered; nails with an injury in general should be spoilered if very mild or otherwise not posted. Just bare nails do not need to be spoilered, though some members of the community request/suggest that you do.\n\nNo seeking or giving medical advice. We recognize that nail care can be difficult at times and intimidating for new hobbyists; however, we are collectively strangers and not medical professionals, and cannot assess/diagnose/assist with hand or nail related injuries and concerns.\n\n**The following are examples of posts we cannot allow:**\n\n*    I am new to gel polish and have heard about \u201cHEMA\u201d...or concerns about gel\u2026\n*    Does this look like (allergy/fungus/whatever other medical issue)?\n*    I have a gel allergy, can I use (anything that isn't regular polish)?\n*    As a comment or response: \u201cThis looks like (contact dermatitis/eczema/psoriasis/whatever).\u201d\n\nWe cannot field these questions, we can only ever direct you to consult a medical professional or see a doctor.\n\n### 8. No BST posts.\n\nPlease take buy/sell/trade/ISO (BST) to our companion subreddit, r/RedditLaqueristaSwap.\n\n### 9. No soliciting users.\n\nNo tolerance policy for people who DM or message our users soliciting them inappropriately. Report inappropriate or uncomfortable comments or DMs and we will act accordingly (ban).\n\nUser caution: Anything that gets posted to this subreddit is available for anyone on the internet to view. It is not necessary to be a subscriber or have a Reddit account to view images posted here. If you receive a DM via your post in our sub, please read [this moderator announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/1dl0cnc/rredditlaqueristas_moderator_announcement/) before you engage in any way.\n\n### 10. No AI.\nUnless you're asking in the post title if a pic is AI generated, no AI pics are allowed..",

    "description": "Welcome to [**/r/Destiny2**](/r/destiny2)\n\n----\n\n# [Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/about/rules/)\n\n 1.  **SPAM/LOW EFFORT CONTENT** Frequently (re)posted questions/content that serve to karma farm, mislead, troll or inspire rage inducing threads, are Spam. Constructive criticism is thought out, not directional, and provides avenues of approach to problem-solving. Low Effort is any/all content that contains no creativity or thought.\n 2. **ABSOLUTELY NO WITCH-HUNTING:** No Personal Attacks. Information directly or indirectly leading users to the person(s) you have shown in a negative light will result in an Immediate temporary ban. Humorous names or fun natured screenshots or posts are always welcomed. If you suspect cheating, even with evidence, should be directed to Bungie Official channels. This is not, nor will it ever be, the place to do so.\n 3. **LFG/RECRUITMENT** No Looking For Guardians posts. Check r/RaidSherpa, r/CrucibleGuidebook, or the LFG in-app avenues for assistance. All LFG posts will be removed and frequent posts will result in a temporary ban. \n 4. **NSFW CONTENT/VULGARITY:** Explicit Content, Slurs, or Offensive material is forbidden. Strive for PG-13 rating and use common sense when determining if content, to include comments, falls here. If you believe yours might but are unsure, message the mod team for assistance.\n 5. **SELF-PROMOTION, ADVERTISEMENTS, OR GIVEAWAYS:** Moderator approval must be given for posts containing or pertaining to Self Promotion or Giveaways. Social Media accounts, to include Discord Servers, are prohibited. YouTube videos, that are creative or provide discussion will be allowed (See Rule 1 for Low Effort content)\n 6. **DISCUSSION OF THIRD PARTY DEVICES, SOFTWARE, OR SERVICES:** Third Party Devices/ Macros in accordance with *Bungie guidelines* will be permitted. Posts regarding any device or service used to manipulate the game outside of the aforementioned guidelines will result in your permanent removal from r/Destiny2. \n 7. **RELEVANT TO DESTINY 2:** r/Destiny2 is a subreddit dedicated to Destiny 2. Content will reflect that or it will be removed. \n 8. **SIMPLE LOOT/ACHIEVEMENT/GEAR ROLL POSTS:** Screenshots, directly captured or not, that are a weapon roll, armor roll, or achievement are spam. See Rule 1. Comparing rolls, or perks is boring and uninspired. You will be referred to Destiny Item Manager (DIM), Destiny Recipes, or Destiny Massive Breakdowns spreadsheet. r/Destiny2 is not for those posts. \n 9. **UNORIGINAL/NON-UNIQUE VIDEOS OR CLIPS:** Unoriginal/Achievement videos or clips are not for this subreddit.

    "description": "#***Coin Collecting - Coin News - Coins in History***\r\n\r\nWe welcome longtime collectors, as well as brand new ones and non-collectors. Please read our pinned How-To Guide for important info on using r/coins. Thank you!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#R/COINS RESOURCES\r\n##[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq)\r\n##[Frequent Coins List (FCL)](https://r-coins.com/fcl/)\r\n##[What's Up With My Coin? List (WUWMC)](https://r-coins.com/wuwmc/)\r\n##[Lincoln LG/SM Date Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/guides/lincoln-date-varieties/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n  |  |  \r\n:--|:--|:-:  \r\n**Rule 1** - ***Don't put coins up your nose***|The main purpose of this sub is to provide a place to learn about, discuss, and show off your favorite coins from around the world. Your participation here requires that you be respectful of the hobby and your fellow collectors. Posts and comments which are made with the sole intention of disrespecting coins or collectors will be removed. This includes \"coin gore\" - pictures of severely damaged coins with no particular numismatic interest.\r\n**Rule 2** - ***Being civil to other people is not only appreciated here, it's a requirement***|Behavior that is unkind and unhelpful is not allowed here. Don't make fun of new collectors. Do not bicker. Don\u2019t threaten. Don't name-call. Don\u2019t shame. Don\u2019t harass. Don\u2019t be a jerk. Don\u2019t create or respond to drama. Don\u2019t troll others or let yourself be trolled. Don\u2019t engage in uncivil exchanges. You do not \"have the right to defend yourself\" verbally here. Know when to disengage. Violation of this rule will get your post or comment removed, and repeated offenses will result in probation.\r\n**Rule 3** - ***No spam***|NO SPAM. This also means not flooding r/coins with many posts in a short amount of time, even if they are non-commercial in nature. Please don't exceed 2 posts in a 24-hour period, or a total of 3 posts in 48 hours. Reposts will be removed without comment unless cleared with mods in advance. If you have a large collection to post, please create an imgur album and post the link.\r\n**Rule 4** - ***No posts about paper money, or crypto/digital currency***|Posting pictures of or asking about paper money? Please go to r/papermoney, r/uspapermoney, r/BankStrapHunting or r/banknotes and give them the additional traffic. If your post contains photos of both coins and paper money it will very likely be removed.  Also, please don't make posts here about digital / crypto / blockchain currency or related products. They aren't real coins according to our definition and this isn't the place for them. Any such posts made here will be removed as spam.\r\n**Rule 5** - ***No self-promotion or commercial activity allowed, no links to your blogs, websites, or social media***|NO self-promotion. Do NOT post links or references to your social media accounts, YouTube channels, websites, etc. NO offers to buy, sell or trade coins in discussion threads, use PM/DM instead. NO direct links to individual items actively for sale on eBay or other sales sites. Search results or already sold items are okay. If you wish to buy, sell or trade your coins please consider posting to r/PMsForSale, r/CoinSales, r/CoinBay, or r/CoinSwap.\r\n**Rule 6** - ***No politics or religion, especially divisive comments that lead to heated arguments and incivility***|Politics and religion - especially partisan politics - can sometimes have a bearing on the world of coins. However, in the interest of avoiding heated off-topic arguments, we ask that you avoid those subjects on this subreddit. This also isn't the place to discuss your religious beliefs or opinions, or those of others. Let's try to keep things calm and civil here please.\r\n**Rule 7** - ***Memes, Humor, and Trash posts***|Memes can be posted on the first Monday of the month and must not break any of the other rules. Trash posts are satirical, trollish, poor quality, meant to derail discussions or cause the biggest reaction with the least effort. These posts may be removed without notice. Humor isn't forbidden, but all posts must reflect the legitimate purpose of this sub, and be in the pursuit of the goals of our hobby. Any reference \"tree-fiddy\" will be removed - this joke needs to die.\r\n**Rule 8** - ***Keep it clean***|Vulgarity, obscenity, violence, sexual innuendo, and other potentially offensive content in posts or comments is subject to immediate removal without notice. This sub WILL remain a safe place for everyone - including children. Legitimate coin images or related posts depicting or referencing NSFW themes MUST be flaired \"NSFW\". Coins depicting nudity, violence, or racism (including Nazi coins) which have a numismatic significance ARE ALLOWED on this sub \u2013 but you must use the NSFW flair!\r\n**Rule 9** - ***Do your own research before posting***|Low-effort posts will be removed. Your question may be removed for failing to do minimal research, failing to read the pinned comment, FAQ, \"Frequent Coin List\", or \"What's up with my coin?\". Please don't consider this criticism or punishment - it is our intent to keep the feed free of questions which can be easily answered by the author prior to posting. If you aren't sure whether you should post, please reach out to the mod team for guidance.\r\n**Rule 10** - ***Post Original Content***|Posts with pictures should be original content. Screenshots should be cropped/edited to only include the necessary portions of the picture (e.g. removing phone screen controls, excluding names/companies/PII/etc.) Anything which may be promoting a sale or company will be removed. Screenshots of outrageously priced coins or from dubious websites will be removed. Posts with unrelated \"for attention\" pictures will be removed.\r\n**Rule 11** - ***No reposts***|Exact posts which have already been made in the past will be removed. Your previous post not getting an answer or attention is not a valid reason to re-post - however you may attempt to make a better post (clearer pictures, etc.) If you are re-posting to fix a rule violation in a previously removed post, please contact the mods first for approval to repost. If you repost (without approval from the mods) simply because your previous post was removed, your will receive a 3-day ban.",

Some consider tightlacing to be wearing your corset at high reductions, some consider tightlacing to be occasional, and others consider it to be a lifestyle choice in which one wears their corset regularly. This community accepts all of these definitions equally, so long as the garment you are wearing is true corset. We do not condone fajas or any other stretchy garments masquerading as corsets.\n\nTo help you, we have compiled some resources. The [Blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tightlacing/comments/du7gdn/blacklisted_brands/),  the [Recoomended brands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tightlacing/comments/du8wyf/brands_to_consider/), as well as r/waisttraining's [Waist Training For Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/waisttraining/comments/ie4h2h/waist_training_beginners_information/) which contains a plethora of useful information, and not just for beginners!\n\nRules:\n\n1. This is an inclusive community.  We are inclusive of all genders, identities, and body types, period. This is non-negotiable. Body/identity snark will be tolerated. \n\n2. This community is for the use of corsets only, we do not condone the use of fajas or stretchy shapewear falsely labeled as corsets. Any posts relating to these garments will be removed. \n\n3. Please do your best to avoid perpetuating misinformation. We realize that there is little evidence for much of what is accepted to be true of corsetry, however, we will not tolerate any behaviors pushing misinformation or negative stereotypes. Do your best to provide reliable information and sourcing. If you are unsure, simply add a disclaimer to your statement or ask for assistance. \n\n4. Abusive behaviors will not be tolerated. This includes snark as detailed in rule 1, as well as other forms of aggression. Please help us to keep the community positive and supportive.\n\n5. Please direct all NSFW posts to r/corsetsnsfw and r/corsetsgonewild. This is a community for the tightlacing lifestyle. Porn, nudes, and other cheeky content is better suited in other communities. This allows our users to better control their content exposure. We understand that there may be some relevant content which may need to be tagged NSFW due to the nature of corsetry, and this is entirely permissible. \n\nRules are subject to change. Changes will be made in the sidebar/community info. Thank you in advance for your understanding and compliance.",

Pregnancy scare posts will be removed.**\n\n\n\n**The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.**\n\n\n\nThis space is for all pregnant people from all walks of life. Whether you're trying to conceive or currently in labor, whether you're a surrogate or a birth parent, whether you're keeping your baby or choosing abortion or are undecided, we are here to be a safe and supportive resource for you.\n\nPlease note these important subreddit rules: \n\n1.  **Respect pregnant people's choices without judgement.** Nobody is too young, too poor, too single, too manly, too gay, too *whatever* to be pregnant. No pregnant person needs you to tell them that they're eating wrong, drinking wrong, weighing wrong, exercising wrong, or doing wrong by their pregnancy. \n\n2.  **This space is pro-choice.** No links to anti-choice material or websites allowed, no anti-choice comments allowed.\n\n3. **No body policing.** Please take your weight loss/gain comments and links elsewhere. \n\n4. **Bigotry will not be tolerated.** Please hit the report button if you see any racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, transphobic, etc. comments to help mods remove them promptly. We are a [friend of the fempire](http://redd.it/r6h1s).\n\n5. **Please do not promote or link to other pregnancy subreddits here.** Some relevant subreddits are listed below with necessary warnings, but in our experience some other subreddits have very little moderation, which means lots of bigotry and hostility towards pregnant people. This is a safe space. Links to such subreddits do not belong here. \n\n6. **Asking if you or someone you know could be pregnant will result in a ban.** Nobody on the internet can tell you if someone is pregnant. Take a test.\n\n7. **Questions regarding medical issues must be submitted to the sticky post.** Starting Oct 23, 2017, all medical questions must be submitted to the stickied post. Any questions posted individually will be removed and redirected.\n\n\n**RELATED SUBREDDITS**\n\n\n\n- /r/miscarriage - a safe and supportive space for those who have experienced miscarriage\n\n- /r/plusSizedPregnancy - a safe and supportive private subreddit for the pregnant and plus sized.

All image/video only posts or posts that require images will be removed. Please feel free to post your pictures and videos - including engagement ring photos- any other day of the week! (Please note videos must be hosted on v.Reddit or Streamable). \n\n**4. No memes/funny gif posts:** \n\n* /r/trollxweddings is a better place for these.\n\n**5. No bashing posts** \n\n* We do not allow bashing posts such as \"what's a tradition you hate?\" or \"what decor is overrated?\u201d or \"what are your unpopular wedding opinions\". Weddit is made up a diverse group of people with diverse traditions. Treating the typical wedding in your area as THE right version of weddings is not cool. We should treat other weddings the way we want ours treated.\n\n**6. No 'tacky'**\n\n* We generally don't allow the use of the word tacky here, including asking 'is this tacky'. 'Tacky' is subjective, not descriptive, and too often weaponized. Situations vary greatly, and there is no one sole arbiter of etiquette. We also don't allow debates on the etiquette of cash bars.\n\n**7. No Advertising, Market Research, or GoFundMe Links**\n\n* No monetizing the subreddit. This includes but is not limited to: advertising, self-promoting, sharing your work, affiliate links, blogs/vlogs, market research / feedback solicitation, free giveaways. Coupons/discounts can be shared in the Daily Discussion Chat. We do not allow GoFundMe, vote solicitations, or other similar requests. \n**Vendor AMAs:** Please contact the mods first for verification. Please note that you cannot advertise in your AMA.\n\n**8. Post multiple photos in an album, not as multiple posts**\n\n* When sharing multiple pictures in a short period of time, please post them in an album/in the same post. Repeat or similar posts that do not uniquely contribute to discussion may be removed. \n\n**9. Privacy/identifying information**\n\n* You may include your own names and faces at your discretion. Addresses  and last names of other people must be obscured, and wedding website URLs are not allowed.\n\n**10. Don't share Weddit content elsewhere**\n\n* No sharing other posts, pictures, etc from Weddit to other groups without the express permission of the original poster. Especially do not share to any shaming forums, or in order to be negative about or mock anyone.\n\n\n**11. Use that report button:** \n\n* If you feel a post is in violation of any of the rules, or is inappropriate content, please click the report button underneath the post or comment. \n\n---\n\n**The Mods.** If you need help please [send us a message.](http://goo.gl/5xlujx) **All posts from new users or users with negative karma are held for mod approval.**\n\n---\n\nHere's a list of [Helpful Wedding Websites](http://goo.gl/PQt7Il)\n\n---\n\n**FAQ Fridays!

    "description": "##What we're about:\n\n* The place for coupons, discounts, sales and all things when it comes to Frugal Female Fashion! Please see our growing Wiki for more details on fits, stores, best value and more. \n\n##What type of Posts are allowed?\n\n* Deals (markdowns, sales, price slashes, special offers, coupons, price promotions), discussions, reviews of products you purchased recently, a brand or anything else that would fall under a constructive and helpful review.\n* Swag Brag posts from thrift stores are **no longer allowed** and will result in a temporary ban.  Only post swag brag if it is from an accessible sale from a nation-wide store. \n\n## What can't I post?\n\n* Any referral code of any type except Amazon Smile, (includes \"PM me for referral\" posts), videos, blogs, news articles. Basically, if it's not a deal, discussion, or review don't post it. \n\n* Amazon & eBay links are on an approval basis. Automoderator will automatically remove these, but the mod team will review them and approve based on the legitimacy of the deal provided.  Items shipped and sold by Amazon or eBay goods will most likely be approved depending on their value to the subreddit. If you try and circumvent the automoderator removal by posting an additional link with a different URL you will be banned for 7 days. \n*  Shortened URL's. \nPlease post the full website link when submitting a post\n* No links to AliExpress, Romwe, Cupshe, Alie Voss, or Sheinside. \n Although you may be able to find great reps, these items ship from China and several FFF users have experienced issues such as misrepresented items or shipping errors.  As always, please use consumer caution when purchasing items from these websites.\n* We do not allow self-promotion. That means if you own the business or work for the business, your post will be removed.  Astroturfing accounts will be banned permanently. \n\n* All referral codes other than Amazon Smile must go in the [Referral Link Master Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/81fgps/referral_link_master_post/) only. \n\n##Why did my post get removed?\n\n* Chances are it broke rules of the subreddit. Automoderator removes all links from accounts that are new or have less than a combined comment/link Karma of 50 to prevent spam.  If you feel your post has been unjustly removed, please send a message to the mods. \n\n## For Companies:\n\n* We do not allow any self-promotion as of 3/13/16 to protect our users. \n\n##About Frugality\n\n* If you don't think something is frugal, don't buy it! Everyone's definition of frugal is different :).\n\n* Do not post saying something isn't frugal.  Everyone has a different definition of frugality.\n\n* Violations of this rule are an automatic 7 day temporary ban.\n\n##Advice\n\n* If you're looking for actual advice on your style, we would love to help you, but we also recommend the lovely ladies over at /r/femalefashionadvice    \n* If you are in Canada, feel free to visit our sister sub /r/frugalfemalefashionCA\n* If you are in the EU, feel free to visit our sister sub r/FrugalFemaleFashionEU\n\n**Ban Information**\n\n* On Frugality rule violations: 7 days.\n\n* Spam: 7 days - permanent, depending on the type/severity.\n\n* Referral codes/affiliate links: 30 days.\n\n* Astroturfing/self-promotion/vote manipulation/doxxing/personal attacks: permanent.\n\n\n\n\n## Looking for a Guide?\n\n* [Basic: Body Type Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/33rln6/guide_body_type/)\n\n* [FFF Budget Ranges](http://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/wiki/index)\n\n* [Guide to Frugal Fashion](http://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/wiki/index)\n\n\n* [Frugal Female Fashion Basics Guideline](http://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/3741kj/frugal_female_fashion_basics_guideline_524)\n\n## Flair Filters\n\n[Advice](/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/search?q=flair%3A%27Advice%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)| [Item Request](/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/search?q=flair%3A%27Item%2BRequest%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)\n---|---\n[Sale/Deal](/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/search?q=flair%3A%27Sale/Deal%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on) |[Sale Expired](/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/search?q=flair%3A%27SALE%2BEXPIRED%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)\n[Swag Brag](/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/search?q=flair%3A%27Swag%2BBrag%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on) |[Announcement](/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/search?q=flair%3A%27Announcement%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)",

    "description": "#Want Flair?\n\nClick the (edit) button \u21e7 up above!\n\n[](/safe-space)\n\n#### [](#h4-green)\n\n>This subreddit is by and for people who are Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities (GSRM), including but by no means limited to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people, and respect for our diversity and experiences is paramount. All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:\n\n-------------\n\n\n# Rules\n\n---\n\n>###1: Be respectful   \nNo GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: \"[TW] Title of Post\". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.\n\n---\n\n>###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive'   \nDemonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just \"shouldn't be so sensitive.\" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. \n\n---\n\n>###3: No bait-and-switch posts   \nBait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.\n\n---\n\n>###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders   \nr/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.\n\n---\n\n>###5: No survey and research requests   \nWe are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.\n\n---\n\n>###6: No promoting hate   \nHaving posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n>###7: Don't share hate speech    \nr/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.\n\n---\n\n>###8: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail!   \nPlease send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.\n\n---\n\n>###9: NSFW Content.   \nr/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.\n\n---\n\n>###10: Provide sources when sharing news\nWe require any post sharing news/social media reactions to news articles to include a link to the original article or announcement in the post body.\n\n---\n\n>###11: No posts asking to rate, roast, or make assumptions about you or your identity.\nThese posts encourage stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on presentation. Often these can make people uncomfortable and bring out a mix of stereotypes and pressure to present a specific way. This rule includes, but is not limiting to; asking whether or not you pass, asking people to guess your gender/sexuality, and asking people to make assumptions about you based on your appearance.\n\n---\n\n>###12: Moderator Discretion.\nUnfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.\n\n>###13: Use Content Warning flair for upsetting posts.\nIf you think community members might be upset by the content you are sharing, use the content warning flair, adding a short description. The post will be automatically marked as a spoiler, but please check our rules on NSFW content and sharing hate.\n\n\n-------------\n\n#[Important Information on Staying Safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/kytz4c/a_reminder_on_staying_safe_online_for_all_our/)\n\n---\n\n#[Report Rule Breaking Content](https://www.reddit.com/report)\n\n---\n\n#[Interested in becoming a Mod?

Low-quality posts clutter the subreddit and tend to be repetitive. Examples of low-quality posts: \u201cWhat is my [face shape, eye shape, skintone]\u201d questions, glow up requests, compliment fishing, non-beauty advice, sympathy farming, attention seeking, and vague-titled posts.\n\nFor more examples of low quality/off-topic posts, please visit the [/r/beauty wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/beauty/wiki/index). \n\n**2. NO SPAM.**\n\nNO spam allowed. No surveys. No links to your own blog posts or social media accounts. No YouTube videos. No promotional websites. No link codes. No porn. NO SELF PROMOTIONS! NO SPAM ACCOUNTS. (Yes, some brand accounts and porn accounts count as spam too.) No AI/ChatGPT.\n\n**3. Self posts, pictures, and videos are allowed as long as they're your own content.**\n\nSelf posts, pictures, and videos are acceptable, but should be your own content (or give credit to the source) and be useful to the community. Pictures and videos can directly be uploaded to Reddit. Links to YouTube and TikTok videos are not permitted.\n\n**4. NO PORN.**\n\nWe are not an 18+ subreddit. We're counting porn (and similar posts) as spam and instant-ban worthy. Posts or comments with porn, nudity, toplessness, privates showing, only fans promotions, and the like will be removed. Commenters/posters that violate this rule will be banned. Please report any porn-related content that you see.\n\n**5. Harassment can get you banned. Permanently.**\n\nWe enforce Reddit\u2019s site-wide rules. Rude, offensive, judgmental, sexualized/thirsty, and generally mean comments will be removed and the user risks being banned at the mods' discretion. Please report any comments that fit this description so we can act accordingly.\n\n**6. Moderator discretion.**\n\nModerators reserve the right to make decisions in the best interests of the sub and its users. Attempting to evade the sub's rules or filters is a bannable offense.",

If that is not for you, there are other trans subreddits that might be more to your liking.\n\n\nRelated subreddits:\n\n\n* /r/mtf\n* /r/ftm\n* /r/ftmfashionadv\n* /r/srsgsm\n* /r/transgenderuk\n* /r/transeducate\n* /r/transtimelines\n* /r/transtryouts\n* /r/transgenderteens\n\n---\n\n[Link to our discord!](https://discord.gg/d563VdHnsb)\n[](/safe-space)\n\n---\n\nIf you are questioning your gender or would like to help people who are questioning their gender, we have partnered with [The Orchard](https://discord.gg/wnuc8mDcWm), a discord server meant specifically for this.\n\n---\n\n# r/trans Rules\n\n---\n\n1. No Hate Speech - No hate speech allowed whatsoever. This is a ZERO tolerance policy. This rule includes any terminology that is used as a slur or pejorative against anyone; even if you\u2019ve personally reclaimed the word, does not mean everyone has, and we ask that you respect that when speaking with other users.  \nIf you must use a slur to in your submission, we ask that you censor it as follows: F-slur, T-slur, S-slur, etc. Using asterisks or other symbols to censor part or all of the word is not acceptable.\n\n2. Be Respectful - Respect the people who belong here. Including:\n    - No insulting transgender people, their appearance, or purposeful misgendering.\n    - No treating being transgender as a mental illness or as being lesser in any way.\n    - No arguing with transgender people about their identity.\n    - No arguing with transgender people about their vulnerabilities, including anything related to sports, laws, etc.\n    - Anything else the Moderation Team deems disrespectful.\n\n3. Prohibited Post Types - To maintain a positive, inclusive, non-confrontational environment, we reserve the right to prohibit certain types of posts on this subreddit. This includes, but is not limited to:\n    - Videos or Podcasts\n    - Debates that challenge any facet of transgender existence\n    - Asking for any critique of your appearance\n    - Requests for name advice\n    - Requests for medical advice, including DIY HRT\n    - For a complete list of prohibited topics, please see this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/ppt/\n\n4. This Space is for Transgender People \u2013 While we appreciate that many cisgender people want to support transgender people, r/trans is a space for transgender people to discuss their lives and issues that surround them, and submissions from outside of the community are not welcome in this subreddit.  \nIf you are a cis person with a question about the trans community, or the partner of a cis person, please ask your question in r/AskTransgender.  \nIf you are the parent of a trans child, you can ask your questions in r/cisparenttranskid.\n\n5. No Pornography or Suggestive Posts \u2013 Posts that are pornographic or sexually explicit are prohibited. This includes:\n    - Nudity below the waist or \"female presenting nipples\" (This is Reddit's guidelines).\n    - Images of a person wearing solely underwear\n    - Images that entice through sexy or flirty posing\n    - Deliberately provocative titles (such as \"Would you date me?\")\n    - Erotica/\"text porn\"\n    - Note that we do allow NSFW text posts that discuss issues a user may be having in their life.\n\n6. No Gatekeeping Ideologies - Our subreddit is one specifically aimed at allowing people to explore their identity and creating a safe space for those identities to be explored. Truscum, transmedicalist, and other gatekeeping ideologies do not serve our subreddit's goals and comments or posts promoting such are prohibited. This specifically includes suggesting that gender affirming medical care should only be available to adults.\n\n7. No Advertisements, Surveys, Petitions, or Crowdfunding \u2013We do not allow advertising or promotion of any kind on r/trans. This includes links to things such as OnlyFans, Instagram, Discord, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, or any sort of crowdfunding websites.  \nIf you wish to advertise a new transgender-related subreddit, please Message the Moderation Team using the link below.\n\n8. No Sharing Hate Speech/Bigtory \u2013 We do not allow sharing images, links, or crossposts containing hate speech or bigoted content. As trans people, we face enough bigotry in our daily lives, and we do not want our users exposed to such content just by scrolling through the subreddit nor to provide the originator a larger platform.  \nYou are welcome to describe what you experienced in a text post for the purposes of venting or seeking help. Please remember to flair the post as \u201cTrigger\u201d or \u201cPossible Trigger\u201d as is appropriate.\n\n9. No Posts About Self Harm or Suicide \u2013 We understand that life can be difficult, and at times life can feel overwhelming or that you have no other options, but there are always options available, we promise you that. If you are experiencing a crisis, we ask that rather than making a post here, please reach out to one of the resources listed on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines), where most country\u2019s crisis lines are listed, as we\u2019re unable to host posts about suicide and self-harm here.\n\n10. Address The Community Respectfully \u2013 Please keep in mind that we are a diverse community, with many different experiences, and we expect our members to respect that when making posts/comments. We ask that you remember that this is not a community specifically for any one gender, and that you don't address the community in that way. This includes things that says something like \"Hey (guys/girls/dudes/women/men)\" and the like.\n\n11. Adult Content Accounts \u2013 Accounts that have a history of posting adult content, participate in adult content subreddits, or have links to adult content services in their profile are not permitted to participate in this subreddit. r/trans is an all-ages space, and we have an obligation to protect our underage users from being exposed to adult content.  \nPlease see this link for further information on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/rjl6id/updated_nsfw_rules/\n\n12. Chasers are Not Welcome Here \u2013 r/trans is a safe space for trans people, their stories, discussions, and content. It is NOT a place for people to fetishize us, attempt to hit on or pick up users, or any other general creepy behavior (\u201cChaser\u201d behavior). Similarly, if such behavior is seen in your account\u2019s post/comment history, you are not permitted to participate in r/trans. The Moderation Team maintains discretion as to what is included in this rule.\n\n13. No DM Requests \u2013 Users are not allowed to ask others to DM, chat with, or contact them on another platform for ANY reason. This subreddit is for finding community, not establishing one-on-one connections or friendships.  \nThis rule does not prohibit users from looking for support groups or other such activities in their area; it is specifically prohibiting \u201cmaking friends\u201d or other other private communication requests.\n\n# [Read our Expanded Rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/expanded-rules)\n\n# [Read about our Prohibited Post Types here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/ppt)",

Your post should be relevant, inclusive, and encourage discussion.\n\n* Titles should be in the form of a question; if this is not possible, make sure the post title or content provides a starting point for discussion. \n* Posts that *can* be applied broadly *must* be applied broadly.\n * Don't ask things specifically of a given group if the question is applicable outside that group.\n * Use inclusive language, e.g. not \"How did you ladies choose a female name?\" but instead \"How did you find your new name?\"\n* Image submissions are disabled. Do not link through to images.\n\n##### 2. Be respectful. \nNo:\n\n* bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, etc) or [gendered slurs](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs),\n* hateful speech or disrespectful commentary,\n* personal attacks,\n* [invalidation](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation), [gender policing](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing), or shaming based on stealth, open or closeted status.\n\n##### 3. No trolling or personal agendas. \nPosts and comments made with such ulterior motives are not allowed.\n\n##### 4. No stirring the pot. \n* Do not post threads that intentionally create drama or encourage witch-hunting.\n* Do not post threads about ongoing drama elsewhere (on other subreddits, on other websites, in the news, etc.) - political discussion is expected and permitted.\n* Do not target other subreddits, link to threads in other subreddits, or otherwise encourage brigading.\n\n#####5. Minors **under the age of 13** are not allowed on Reddit. \n> [Although we welcome users from all walks of life, Reddit is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy#wiki_children_under_13)\n\n##### 6.  [Get mod approval](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasktransgender) before posting a questionnaire, survey, promotion, or advertisement. \n\n* Please review [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/rule6) for these types of post. \n\n* We do not allow fundraising posts/requests under any circumstances.\n\n##### 7. Mark NSFW posts. \nPosts that center around genitals, breasts, sex, or content you would not discuss with coworkers, your grandmother, or other delicate company should be marked as NSFW.\n\n##### 8. No fetishization or chasers. \n\n* We will remove any posts treating trans bodies as fetishes or objects, and any posts that indicate your attraction is more important than your partner's dysphoria.\n\n* Do not ask how to meet trans people. This is not a dating subreddit. \n\n---\n\n#Useful Links:\n\n#####[Suicide Hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/suicide_resources)  \n#####[US Informed Consent Clinics](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/d6p05q/i_compiled_every_single_informed_consent_clinic/)  \n\n#####[Wiki](/r/asktransgender/wiki) | [Glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/glossary) | [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/faq) | [Related Subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/linked) | [Sticky Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/stickyarchive)\n\n---\n\n#Medical Disclaimer:\nThe members of this subreddit do not act as medical professionals.

    "description": "-----\n\n##Rules (read before posting):##\n\n*(Hover over each box to expand it)*\n\nSome|Rules\n:-:|:-:|:-:\n1. Respect other users|... Even when those users show disrespect themselves. We're better than the trolls and haters, and we can show that by not rising to take the bait. Be respectful, and we'll all be happier for it.\n2. No abuse|Abuse is absolutely banned here, and is treated extremely seriously. Abusive users will be banned.\n3. Discrimination is forbidden|There is no such thing as \"valid discrimination,\" and this sub will remove any post or comment that demonstrates racism, sexism, body shaming or any other bigotry you care to name. Equality is the watchword.\n4. Non-binary does not mean non-trans|Non-op, genderqueer, agender or any other denomination of transgender is still transgender. Treating a person like they're lesser or somehow inferior because they're non-binary is immoral, and shows a clear lack of understanding.\n5. Asking for birthnames is not cool|Asking for, or posting, a person's personal information can be dangerous, and it's also against [the site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules).\n6. Malicious reporting is abuse|Maliciously reporting someone who doesn't break our rules spams the report system, and it's against the site-wide rules. Don't do it.\n7. ABSOLUTELY NO PORN!|There are places online which cater to that *particular* fetish, but this is not one of them. Users who are here to post porn or advertise will be removed.\n8. Tag any NSFW stuff|If you got a cool tattoo or something else that's incidentally NSFW, please tag it as such.\n9. Destructive criticism is abuse|It's hard to convey inflection and intent via text. What may seem like tough love to one person may come across as hatred or abuse to another. It's not helpful, don't do it.\n10. No soliciting medical advice|We're not doctors and we can't vouch for the safety or validity of any medical information. Posts that ask for or give advice on how to obtain or use DIY hormones will be removed, as will comments that explicitly state where to get black-market drugs. These are dangerous medications, not toys.\n11. Submissions or comments from users with 0 or less karma will be removed|This is to prevent trolling. If you have less than 0 karma, you won't be allowed to submit here. This is a hard rule.\n12. No \"X celebrity/politician is a transphobe\" threads|We all probably already know and we don't need that kind of negativity in our **Safe Space.**\n13. If you want to promote something, message the moderators first|This sub is a **Safe Space,** not a knowledge aggregator, not a traffic generator, and certainly **not a public wallet.** There are far better places like /r/transspace to post surveys or tell people about a trans-related service or group. (You should ask the mod(s) there before posting too.)\n14. Do not disrupt the **Safe Space**|If the mods think you're being too much of an arsehole, but it's not covered by the rules, your post will be removed and you might be banned. We want to cultivate a warm, **Safe Space** environment, and anything that goes against that may be subject to removal and the submitter to disciplinary action.\n15. Please keep all selfies in the selfie thread.|Please keep all selfies in the selfie thread or post them on another subreddit that's releveant. Any selfies outside of the selfie thread will be removed. Photos of IDs and medications are also forbidden because they include personal and/or medical information.\n\n##General Guidelines:##\nGeneral|Guidelines\n:-:|:-:|:-: \nComment with respect| It's important to remember that behind every username is an individual with motivations, goals, and problems just like you. We never really know what the situation is on the other side of the keyboard, so please try to be mindful of what you say and how you treat others.\nVote with care| This is a safe place for people who need to talk about their life as a trans person. If we downvote posts and comments into the ground, we discourage free expression. Save your downvotes for trolls.\n\"Will I pass\" threads are discouraged| Whilst not banned, WIP threads are discouraged from being posted here. If you do post these threads, please accept that our official policy is honesty: if you do not pass, or might not pass in the future, subscribers are encouraged to tell you this (in the nicest possible way). We are not here to lie to you.\n\n***\n\n**Other subreddits you might like:**\n\n* /r/asktransgender - Self-posts and questions from trans people\n* /r/ftm - For the FAAB among us\n* /r/genderqueer - For non-binary folks\n* /r/transadorable - Adorable trans people selfies: child-friendly!\n* /r/transgender - Transgender articles and links\n* /r/transpositive - Success stories and posts\n* /r/TransSpace - A safe place for all trans-identified people\n* /r/transvoice - A voice-coaching subreddit for transgender people of all genders.

This includes when responding to to rule-breakers (if someone breaks rules, don't engage & report them to mods).\n* 2. **No bigotry.** Including but not limited to content that marginalizes, discriminates against, or demeans any group based on gender identity, ethnicity, religion, race, nationality, body size, appearance, sex, or any other characteristic.\n* 3. **No sexual feedback.** This includes any kind of harassment, sexualization, objectification, photo or message requests or unsolicited PMs.\n* 4. **No upsetting the safe space.** It's important that we keep a [Safe Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_space). Creeps are unwelcome. \n* 5. **No surgery shaming.** Do not shame reductions, augmentations, breast lifts, etc.\n* 6. **No pseudoscience.** Discussions about pseudoscience are allowed, however it is prohibited to present pseudoscientific claims as a legitimate medical advice. This includes for example homeopathy, chiropractic and acupuncture.\n* 7. **No porn or porn-adjacent accounts.** Mods reserve the right to remove posts and comments at their discretion. No porn, self-promotion, or posting pictures that are also posted to NSFW subs. Provide context to your photos to prevent being mistaken for a bot or spam account.\n* 8. **No medical advice.** Instead seek out a professional or visit other subreddits, for example: r/AskDocs, r/Medical_Advice, r/DiagnoseMe, r/SkincareAddiction, r/SkincareAddicts, r/SkinCareScience, r/DermatologyQuestions, r/Eczema, r/Psoriasis\n* 9. **No mentioning your age if you're underage.** This predominantly applies to selfies/picture posts, but we recommend you refrain from it in all submissions where it isn't relevant to the post.\n* 10. **No ban evasion.** New accounts that are identified by Reddit as being banned previously will be automatically banned, and any posts removed.\n* 11. **No message screenshots.** Creepy and rude message screenshots belong in the pinned megathread, not as their own posts. Censor usernames other than your own.\n* 12. **No selfies (except rare exceptions).** They are only allowed here in very specific situations where they are absolutely necessary to gain help. If you're unsure, message mods before posting. And if you think your selfie was removed in error, please reach out to the mods.\n* 13. **No white knighting.** We don't need your [white knighting](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/White_knighting).\n* 14. **No impersonation.** Do not impersonate anyone else via name, picture, or any other way, privately or publicly, for any reason whatsoever.\n___\n\n*[This subreddit is a body snark free zone](http://www.thelingerieaddict.com/2012/04/lingerie-addict-body-snark-free-zone.html).*\n\n##Resources##\n***[Busty Resources](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)***, a boobitor-created wiki, was inspired by the lack of consistent, reliable, and accessible information related to breasts available online.\n\n* [Find your UK Size](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Bra_sizing_by_country)\n* [Find out if your bra fits](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_tell_if_a_bra_fits)\n* [Find your breast shape](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Breast_shape)\n* [How to correctly put on a bra](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_put_on_a_bra)\n* [Bust-friendly apparel](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Apparel)\n* [Offline bra retailers](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Offline_retailer)\n* [Online bra retailers](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Online_retailer)\n\n##See also##\n\n###Private BBP Subreddit###\n\n[r/safebigboobproblems](https://www.reddit.com/r/safebigboobproblems/)\n\nPrivate means that the subreddit and all its contents aren't publicly accessible.

They are intelligent, and playful thus making them the 5th most popular dog in the United States and 8th in the UK.

    "description": "## [TallGirls Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TallGirls/wiki/index)\n\n---\n\n##Rules\n\n\n### Who is this sub for?\n\n* It is for anyone identifying as a girl or woman who is also tall. It is not for men. It is not for short people. This rule had to be created and placed at the top of the rules because people have forgotten how to read. If you violate this rule, bans are swift & permanent. If this is not clear, try [this link.](https://irisreading.com/23-tips-to-improve-reading-comprehension-for-adults/)\n\n\n### Be Kind, Be Considerate, Don't Be A Bigot\n\n* Respect differences but find a way to reach common ground or agree to disagree without fighting. \n\n* Cruel & rude comments about body image & gender are never appropriate. \n\n* Don't gatekeep height. Don't put down the not-talls.\n\n* Take a minute to consider the spirit of a post or comment before making a hasty reply.\n\n* Hate speech against protected classes is prohibited. If you're not sure what these are - use a search engine.\n\n* Violations will result in a ban. Not all bans are eligible for appeal.\n\n### Account Age, Karma Limits, & Filters\n\n* Like many communities, we use filters for content, account age, & low karma. \n\n* This means your content may be filtered even if you are a long-time member b/c you triggered a keyword, phrase, or used an image. \n\n* It means if your account is newish, you will likely be filtered. \n\n* It means if your karma is low (or negative) you will be filtered. \n\n* Yes, this sucks, but it is not a personal slight against you as a user. Please just be patient. The threshold is lower for comments - start there!\n\n### Asking About Height/Body\n\n* This rule covers SEVERAL AREAS. **Read fully.**\n\n* Do not ask users for information about their body they haven't already provided. \n\n* We cannot predict the future - don't ask us to! Don't ask when growing stopped for talls, how tall parents are, if your tall child is going to be a tall adult, etc.\n\n* Other height/body-related questions may also fit this rule without being explicitly stated.\n\n* And quit asking everyone about their feet. I think that's fetish bait. Don't answer!\n\n### Body-Negative Threads & Body Talk Flair\n\n* Regarding the Body Talk Flair! \n\n* It's okay to want to grumble about your body (tallness or otherwise). We ask you to do so in a way that doesn't make everyone else feel like you're also grumbling about all bodies. \n\n* Please do the following: \n\n> * Set Body Talk Flair. \n> * Spoiler your post. \n> * Omit negative descriptions & remarks from the **title.** \n\n* For an explanation of this rule [Follow the Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TallGirls/comments/vetntx/a_little_chat_about_our_bodies/)\n\n### Dating & Intimacy Content Limitations\n\n* This sub is for commiseration and camaraderie *among TallGirls*! \n\n* TallGirl to TallGirl Talk ONLY. See the first rule in this sub if you're confused. \n\n* TallGirls can vent about & discuss dating & relationships. Please keep things clean & \"safe-for-work.\" \n\n* Content specifically seeking validation may be removed, especially if it borders into the \"how to make a man like me\" territory. \n\n* Content from minors may be removed. Sorry, kids. \n\n### Safe-For-Work, Profile, and History Rules\n\n* This is a SFW (Safe For Work) sub & a safe space for TallGirls of all ages (within the TOS of Reddit). \n\n* All posts, comments, gifs, links, & images should be SFW.\n\n* Profiles must be SFW. History in fetish & NSFW subreddits will result in a ban. Participation in quarantined subs may result in a ban. Links to off-site platforms that are NSFW may result in a ban. \n\n### No Self-Promo, Advertising, or Surveys\n\n* All promo content should go through modmail - most of it will be denied. The vast majority of requests are very off-topic.\n\n* This includes subversive promotion, i.e., having an account name as a brand while posting & commenting to ensure profile clicks/views. \n\n* Surveys of any kind are also inappropriate for the community at this time.\n\n### Saturday Selfies \ud83e\udd33\n\n* Selfies can be posted on Saturdays. \n\n* Image posts require manual moderation, please be patient with your human moderators!\n\n* If you want to share images outside of Saturday they should not contain faces & bodies (i.e., you can post an outfit on a hanger, but not on you, sorry).\n\n* Selfies should be safe-for-work content only. Feel free to share outfit details in your post - let us know where you're shopping or what you're making. \ud83d\udc97\n\n### If You Are A Man\n\n* This space isn't for you. \n\n* Do not answer questions \"as a man.\" \n\n* Do not post. \n\n* This rule has been simplified from earlier iterations b/c of confusion. If your behavior is unwanted or otherwise annoying you will be banned and the ban will not be eligible for appeal. \n\n---\n\n### Our Sister Sub!: r/Tall, featuring [Talls of the World Discord](https://discord.gg/gmrA5Ux)\n\n---\n\n### Related Subs:\n\n* r/tall\n* r/tallfashionadvice\n* r/TallMeetTall\n* r/BodyAcceptance",

You're free to go and explore the vast wonders of Reddit and find the perfect spot that suits your taste buds.\n\n**5.\nLAST WORD WARRIORS**\nIn this mystical world of Reddit, we implore you to master the fine art of agreeing to disagree.\n\nYes, my friends, it's a magical dance where opposing views collide and harmony emerges. But here's the kicker- when a user declares they're \"done,\" take a hint and back off.\n\nDon't be the pyromaniac, itching to ignite more chaos. Respect their longing for peace, and resist the urge to fuel the fire. Let tranquility prevail, for it's in the graceful act of moving on that true wisdom is found\n\n**6.\nNO Kim Klones Here!**\nBe original, gosh damnit! Shake off that dullness and embrace the extraordinary.\n\nLet your words dance with the fire of originality, captivating all who dare to read them.\n\nWe crave your creative talents, so don't be a timid mouse. Share your thoughts, opinions, and let that juicy insight shine.\n\nDon't you dare be shy! Be original Doll!\n\nand oh yeah, You're doing amazing sweetie!\n\n**7.\nMINOR KIDS and Pictures**\nNews Flash! We ALLOW photos of the KarJenner children, courtesy of their parents, family members, and even media. But there's a catch!\n\nWe won\u2019t tolerate any offensive thoughts, opinions, or comments directed at or about anyone under the age of 18.\n\nSave your critiques and judgments for the adults in their lives and when it comes to the littles, keep your comments respectful.\nKeep the drama focused on the grown-ups where it belongs!\n\n\"Report\" users that can't comprehend or follow the rules!\n\n**8.\nThe ILLUMINATI and TIN FOIL HATS**\nRumors are a part of life and we can tolerate doses and sprinklings of gossip. We draw the line at tinfoil hat-wearing, intergalactic government lizard people, kind of stories.\nThis ain't the place for that nonsense.\n\nWe are separating the Wheat from the Chaff!\nIf you want to make an outlandish claim, show us the money! Proof, evidence, sources, or legit links.\n\nEmbrace the weirdness of reality and leave the insane outlandish space lasers for eyeballs BS at the door.\n\n**9.\nNO DEADNAMING / Pronoun Abuse**\nListen up misinformed souls. NO Deadnaming!\nDeadnaming, is the art of using a transgender person's birth name (pronuns) instead of their chosen name. Even if you're talking about pretransition times, use the chosen name and correct pronouns.\n\nRespect Caitlyn's name and \"She\" / \"Her\" pronouns - even if you don\u2019t respect her, respect the rule.\n\nWhen in doubt of what to use, use \"THEY\"/\"THEM\"\n\nWe don't allow discrimination, therefore this is not debatable. It's bigger than Caitlyn folks!\n\n**10.\n\"ISM's\" and \"Differences\"**\nAlright, you funky rebels! This one is as clear as a neon sign on a desert night. We aren\u2019t down for any racism, homophobia, discrimination, or bigotry in this neck of the digital woods.\n\nSo keep your prejudice at the door and let's groove together in harmony. Embrace the kaleidoscope of humanity, and keep it civil because we celebrate every body here!\n\nIt's self explanatory, my friends! We're here to foster a community of diversity.\n\n\"Report\" those that can't comprehend, capiche?\n\n**11.\nPUFFY VAG, BDE and Personal Fantasies**\nWell folks, we are keepin\u2019 this Sub on the righteous path, so this ain't the spot to flaunt your puffy vaginas, brag about your BDE, or dive into the realm of pornography.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, but we are keeping it somewhat decent!\n\nWe're here to delve into the world of KarJenner drama, not your personal fantasies. So, respect the boundaries, show some restraint.\n\nSexually explicit content will be swept away faster than you can say \"orgasm.\"\n\n**12.\nLOW EFFORT**\nGet off that cushy ass of yours and put in some real work! We're not here for half-assed attempts. When you're posting those juicy links, don't leave us hanging in the dark. Give us some damn context!\n\nWe want to know what we're getting into, what scandalous treasure awaits us. Don't be a tease, spill the tea! This is the KarJenner's, where drama reigns supreme, and we deserve nothing less than your very best.\n\nNow, get out there, sweeties, and let the world witness your snarky brilliance.\n\n**13.\nPEACE be With You, and also with You**\nListen up, you rabble-rousers. If you revel in the art of quarrel, thrive on the thrill of attacking your fellow USERS, or the MODS, this haven of ours is not for you.\n\nWe relish a good debate, a fiery clash of opinions. We savor the bitter taste of cynicism as it dances on our tongues, but draw the line at personal attacks and vile rants.\n\nWe do not revel in the exposure of others' follies - Posting/commenting without removing the names on screenshots from other subs is strictly forbidden.\n\n**14.\nDOXXING (publishing personal information)**\nWe don't mess around with doxxing in this subreddit. Doxxing is the shady act of publishing someone's personal information or revealing their real identity without their consent. And guess what? We don't play that game here!\n\nRespect each other's privacy. We're here to enjoy the snark, the gossip, and the wild ride of the KarJenner's, not to invade each other's personal lives.\n\nLet's keep it fun, respectful, and within the bounds of legal and ethical behavior.\n\nand oh yeah, Report Offenders!\n\n**15.\nAspiring Entrepreneurs**\nWe are not QVC! No selling, promoting products/services/apps! So unless you're willing to split the profits with every single member here (which I highly doubt), save the sales pitch for another time.\n\nLet's not turn this place into a Tik Tok, IG, YouTube channel promotion hub. We're here to enjoy ourselves and engage in lively discussions, not to become subscribers to your personal vlogs.\n\nNow, go forth and conquer the business world elsewhere (and keep the \"buy my ai art\" vibes out of here)",

This a place to discuss fashion, body acceptance and to support one another.**\n\nWHO IS SIZE XXS?\n\n* Anyone who considers themselves to be XXS is XXS! Easy as that. This subreddit is for all genders. A good way to know if you are size XXS is if either A) you own clothing that is that size or B) your relatives constantly tell you to eat more.\n\nWHAT IS SIZE XXS?\n\n* XXS is a clothing size that stands for extra-extra-small. It is different from the size Petite, which is for people 5'4\" and under. The size XXS refers to weight rather than height. A person can be 5'7\" and wear size XXS (or 00 or 000) jeans. Or a person can be 5'1\" and wear size XXS! Basically, a person who wears XXS or 00/000 is very thin.\n* See J. Crew's [clothing size charts & measurements](https://www.jcrew.com/sizecharts/main.jsp) for more information.\n\nWHERE TO FIND SIZE XXS CLOTHING\n\n* Please see our [Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/XXS/wiki/index).\n\nSIMILAR SUBREDDITS\n\n* /r/ABraThatFits\n* /r/BodyAcceptance\n* /r/FemaleFashionAdvice\n* /r/MaleFashionAdvice\n* /r/PetiteFashionAdvice\n* /r/Short\n* /r/ShortFit\n* /r/ShortMen\n* /r/ShortTwoX\n* /r/ShortWomen\n\nIF /R/XXS WASN'T XXX ENOUGH FOR YOU (*NSFW*)\n\n* /r/Petite\n* /r/SkinnyLegs \n* /r/SlimGirls\n* /r/XSmallGirls \n* /r/XXSmall \n\nOTHER COMMUNITIES\n\n* /r/PlusSize\n\nRULES\n\n1.

Remember why you're here: to snark.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAs a snark sub, we need to keep in mind to focus on one thing only: snarking. Our community is strictly for condescension. If you don't agree then we suggest unsubscribing.\n\n*Still disagree with this rule?* Both mods and members of the community believe that MS promotes skewed and prejudiced views, harmful rhetoric, false perceptions of body image, false health claims, and is constantly trying to use her influence to scam and take advantage of others.\n\n**3. Censor faces of everyone but MS.** \n&nbsp;\n\n\nFaces of children, innocent bystanders, frenemies, family members, and C must be blurred/censored.\n\n\n**4. Censor all names.** \n&nbsp;\n\n\nNames in screen shots must be censored--DO NOT ask for MS's full name or social media handles. This is doxxing.\n\n\n**5. No derogatory name calling.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- **NOT OK:** b-tch, sl-t, wh-re, c-nt, and the like.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- **OK:** jerk, jackass, ugly, gross, asshole, cretin, heathen, etc.\n\n\n**6. Examples of posts that will be removed:**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- \"Open Letter\" style posts or comments (\"Hey, MS___.\")\n&nbsp; \n- Links to TikTok posts\n&nbsp;\n- Instagram story infographics; [see this post for clarification](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouniquePresenterMS/comments/zn1qxr/clarification_on_modified_rules_helpful_info/)\n\n\n**7. No member policing/mini-modding.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMember-to-member comment policing will not be tolerated. Use the report function.\n\n\n**8. No sub-related META posts.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNo posts about the subreddit. If you can't handle the snark, sarcasm, and jokes (within the Reddit Content Policy), this sub may not be for you.\n\n\n**9. Moderators have full discretion.** \n&nbsp;\n\n\nPosts will be removed if seen fit by the mods. Do not argue with mods if your post/comment has been removed.\n\n\n**10. Please include the year on all old photos posted of MS to avoid confusion.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**11. No blogging.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNo need to go into details about why you do the same things as MS. We're here to snark on one person only so please refrain from going off topic or commenting about your work life or personal life nor is this the place. Bloggy comments will be deleted. \n\n\n**12. No leg humping.**\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce again, this is a snark sub. We are here to snark on the subject, not to praise her. You can be snarky/critical without resorting to overt compliments.\n\n\n\n### **See [Official Rule Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouniquePresenterMS/about/rules/) for Full List!**\n\n___\n**Other Related Subreddits:**\n\nr/IG_InfluencerTGFH - One of the influencers MS has pathetically copied and wants to be.\n\nr/SouthernHunsofIG - for all the other annoying scammy MLM huns you love to hate.\n___",

    "description": "This is a subreddit devoted to cute little animols such as puppers, cates and turtols if you have some cute turtles post other animols if you want to ok\n\n***\n\n[join our discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/rarepuppers) [not compulsory but its still cool if you do]\n\n***\n#**RULES**\n\n***\n\n1. **Be kind please** \n\n The most important rule! Our sub is intended as family-friendly, so you are encouraged and required to be kind to others. Insults, attacks, flaming, hate speech, and general unkindness will not be tolerated. **Depending on severity, this may lead to a ban.**\n\n2. **No references to or depictions of harm** \n\n Any reference to harming animals, or an animal harming others, is not tolerated. Note: this includes references towards eating the subject of the photo, e.g. a pig or cow. **This rule is strictly enforced, and violations will often lead to a permanent ban.** Not knowing of this rule is not a valid reason for removing your ban. **Animals that are obese to the point of abuse will also be removed.**\n\n3. **All animals are allowed, but your post MUST contain an animal, and the animal must be the focus.**\n\n While our sub is based on puppers, **we allow any sort of animal**, as long as it's cute! However, **your post must contain an animal**. Posts consisting only of collars, stickers, t-shirts, human children, etc, will be removed. Art is allowed, but the post must contain a photo of the animal in question. **Posts that are primarily human-focused (including babies) will be removed** - no selfies with a small blurry dog in the corner.\n\n4. **No swearing, the puppers don't like. [Includes soft swearing]** \n\n Our commitment to kindness and family friendly atmosphere means that we do not allow swear words of any kind on the sub, regardless of strength. All swears must be replaced by alternatives like 'heck, 'gosh', 'dang', etc. Alternatively, consider rewording your sentence to not need it at all. \nNote: \"Soft swearing\", such as b\\*\\*k, b%&k, or b0rk, is equally disallowed.\n**Attempts to intentionally evade the swear filter will result in a ban.**\n\n5. **Put effort into your post. No asking for upvotes or \"Reddit, meet X\" titles.** \n\n Rarepuppers started as a fun place to share silly pictures of animols with a silly title. We want to know what makes the animol fun/unique! Merely stating your pet's name, age, and/or breed isn't enough. Try telling us about a fun personality quirk your pet has, or about something cute or fun they did recently.\n\n Posts asking to ID breed, requesting name ideas, or DNA results are disallowed as such posts tend to flood the subreddit if not removed. Asking for upvotes/comments is also not allowed.\n\n6. **Keep it positive. No sad content and grief threads.** \n\n Rarepuppers aims to be a fun, happy place where viewers can see cute, silly content. **Stories of abuse, death, or violence towards animals, while important to bring awareness to, are not a good fit for this sub.** Other communities, such as /r/PetLoss and /r/OldManDog are a better fit for posts about losing your companion. If you really wish to share your pet here in their final days, please don't mention the end of their life in your title.\n\n7. **OC is preferred. Stolen content is not allowed.** \n\n Our favorite posts are those that come from you! We often pin new OC to the front page each day, and we love seeing photos of your pets and animals. To this end, **we disallow any sort of stolen content, or highly crossposted content**. This includes screenshots of Twitter posts, word-for-word reposts from /r/aww, and other such cases. **Exact letter-for-letter reposts will lead to a ban.**\n\n8. **Frequent and recent reposts are discouraged.** \n\n **If the photo you'd like to post has been shared in the last few weeks, or just a lot in general, we may remove it.** Any post on our top all time will also be removed. New and fresh content is important on our sub.\n\n9. **Banned topics: politics, military and police dogs, adult content, vet advice.**\n\n The following topics are disallowed in posts and comments due to the lighthearted, family-friendly nature of this subreddit: adult content, including sexual and drug references; politics, including animals in service of the police or military; and questions about a pet's health or requests for veterinary advice. If you have concerns about pet health, it is recommended that you ask a professional, rather than throw it out here where anyone can give advice with no guarantee of its accuracy.\n\n10. **Puppertalk is encouraged and welcomed, complaints about it are not.** \n\n We get that not everybody likes our lingo, and that's fine. There are many other animal themed subs for you to browse, and we're totally okay with you steering clear of us. However, this does not give you a license to be rude to our users about how they speak. **Complaints and high-horsing about spelling and pupperspeak will be removed and may lead to a ban.** Just ignore it and go somewhere else.\n\n11. **Controversial pets, harmful practices, and abuse accusations.**\n\n All animals are welcome on rarepuppers (see rule 2), including pets with controversial characteristics or ex. cropped ears. They may be rescued. But, **if there is evidence that the owner is intentionally perpetuating harm**, for example if they are a backyard breeder, **the post may be removed and may lead to a perma-ban**. **Making public accusations of abuse without sufficient evidence is also not allowed**; if you have doubts, it is best to send a modmail expressing your concerns so we can investigate.\n\n\n12. **No breed-shaming.** \n\n Doggos and other pets come in all sorts of breeds. Some are healthier than others, but nevertheless, they are all deserving of love and attention! While we don't condone unhealthy breeding practices, we don't disallow sharing content based on the breed of the animal. This also applies to breeds that are commonly seen as dangerous (e.g. pit bulls). **Due to persistent brigading, anti-pit bull comments are moderated very strictly and will result in a permanent ban.**\n\n13. **Limit of three posts per user per day.** \n\n Do not post more than 3 posts in a 24 hour period of time, this will be considered spam. If you have many related pictures to share, it may be a good idea to post them as a single gallery, instead of separately. Making more than three posts in a 24-hour period is considered spamming.\n\n14. **No solicitation or advertising.**\n\n Rarepuppers does not allow solicitation of any kind. This includes but is not limited to advertising an animal for adoption, foster, or purchase, or facilitating such activities between users; asking for upvotes; requesting donations; sharing affiliate links; and advertising products or services. We allow social media handles / links in comments, but not in titles (rule 5) or photos and videos (this rule).\n\n\n***\n\nPlease remember that this subreddit is not the place to ask for / give medical advice. **Please talk to a veterinarian if your pet is sick.**\n\n***\n\n**[This subreddit stands against hate speech](http://redd.it/3djkz4)**\n\n***\n\n**TERMINOLOGY: [Check out the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/index#wiki_terminology_and_all_that_jazz)**\n***\n#similar subreddits:\n\nwould you like a subreddit featured? send a modmail!\n\n***\n\n#[General cuteness](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_general_cuteness)\n---\n\n#[Puppers](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_puppers)\n---\n\n#[cates](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_cates)\n---\n\n#[birbs](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_birbs)\n\n---\n\n#[turtles](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_turts)\n\n---\n\n#[ottos](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_ottos)\n\n---\n\n#[wabbits](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_wabbits)\n\n---\n\n#[scalie frens](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_scalie_frens)\n\n---\n\n#[big boyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_big_boyes)\n\n---\n\n# [other animols](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_other_animols)\n\n---\n\n#[Other non-animol frens](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_non_animol_frens)",

    "description": "Thanks for joining us at r/service_dogs. We are here to answer your questions about service dogs and emotional support animals, whether you're a curious onlooker, looking to get one for yourself, in the process of training, or an established team. We are not lawyers or professional trainers but we will do our best to try to help you with questions about access or training. If you are new to service dogs, please start with the FAQ in r/dogs linked in the pinned post. \n\n### Rules\n\n* Please be civil; no personal attacks.\n\n* We advocate compliance with all relevant laws, including the ADA/ADAA, FHA/FHAA, and ACAA for U.S. posters. Posts encouraging illegal behavior or \"stretching\" the rules will be removed.\n\n* The moderators will do our best to help you understand the relevant laws in your area but we are not lawyers.\n\n* Posts with bad advice or misinformation will be removed with a comment as to the issue. This is to prevent bad information from continuing to spread. If the post is corrected, it will be approved/undeleted. This includes all links to \"certification\" sites or sites affiliated with such organizations.\n\n* The moderators may, at their discretion, remove comments that promote unethical but technically legal handling practices. \n\n* We do not allow fundraisers for any purpose. Discussions/sharing of ideas for fundraising efforts is permitted, links or requests for funds are not.\n\n### Certification?\n\n* In the US, there is no certification for service dogs. All sites promoting IDs and vests that immediately make your dog a service dog (or ESA) are scams. What makes a service dog a service dog are the tasks that it is trained to do to mitigate your disability.\n\n### US Dept of Justice Publications:\n\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html)\n\n* [Overview of ADA in regards to SDs](http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm)\n\n### Training Resources\n\n* Foundations: [Sue Ailsby's Training Levels](http://sue-eh.ca/page24/page26/page10/)\n\n* Selection, Task Training, and More: Donna Hill's [Service Dog Training Institute](http://servicedogtraininginstitute.ca/) has a blog, extensive Youtube videos, and affordable online classes or individual instruction via Skype.  \n\n* [Denise Fenzi's blog](https://denisefenzi.com/) - not SD specific but lots of wisdom to be found on positive dog training and building a working relationship\n\n* [kikopup's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup): in case you need more help with basic obedience and tricks\n\n### Other Resources:\n\n* [Questions to ask when considering a program](https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/biksr9/questions_to_ask_a_program/)\n\n* [Is a service dog the right tool for you?](https://macandabi.com/2019/03/01/maybe-a-service-dog-isnt-the-right-tool-for-you/?fbclid=IwAR1aOH0g-R2Bqnm5swnhHUFQchrkxl9ahZdjYpJvE7892oksP1WFAdc5XOw)\n\n* Various FB groups - OTSD - Owner Trained Service Dogs, Force Free Service Dogs, etc.\n\n* [International Assoc. of Assistance Dog Partners (IAADP)](http://www.iaadp.org/iaadp-membership-benefits.html) - organization with sponsors who provide some free stuff\n\n* FAQs and Forum - www.servicedogcentral.org\n\n* For pics and gifs of service dogs and other working dogs check out /r/DogsWithJobs!\n\n* If you're thinking about therapy dogs (dogs that visit schools, nursing homes, hospitals, libraries, etc. with their handlers), please visit /r/therapydogs!",

Promoting cruelty, even hypothetically, is not acceptable.\n\n###**No Disclaimers**\n* Posts and comments expressing the sentiment 'I don't hate dogs, but' or 'I love dogs, but' will be removed, as they miss the intent of the sub and are insulting to our members.\n\n* Similarly, though we don't have to agree on everything, posts and comments should be made in good faith and should not attempt to change our members' minds. \n* Mods reserve the right to take action against those exhibiting trolling behavior.\n\n* This sub is for those who do not like or own dogs. Weigh-in from \ndog owners is off topic and disallowed.\n\n\n###**Cats are off topic**\n* This is neither a pro- nor anti-cat sub.  Our various opinions of cats are inconsequential to the topic of dogs and their impact on society.\n\n* Comparisons of dogs vs. cats or dog owners vs. cat owners are explicitly disallowed.\n\n* This is not the place to mention your experiences with cats.\n\n###**Bigotry is not allowed**\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group (such as a religion, race, gender, political affiliation, etc), expressions of bigotry and prejudice, and the pejorative use of slurs are not allowed. Don't bait others into breaking this rule. \n\n###**No low-effort/low-quality posts**\n* Not everything that involves a dog belongs here.\n* Submissions should be thoughtful and should promote quality discussion. News articles and text posts are encouraged. Pictures of dogs or dog-related items, videos of dogs doing gross things, social media screen shots, memes, title-only posts, posts with minimal text, and anything that might be found on r/aww are some examples of low-effort content that do not contribute anything of value to the conversation.\n* Memes and comics are at home over at our sister sub, r/dogfreehumor.\n* [Click here for more information on Low Effort Content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/fdonir/mod_statement_low_effort_content/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n\n###**Avoid reposting**\n* We don't need to see another copy of the same thing that's already on the front page, so before you post, check whether or not your content has already been posted by someone else recently. A quick skim through the first page or two of post titles is very helpful for this.\n* If your post has a different angle on the same subject, or more information, that's fine. \n* News articles should be recent.\n\n###**Direct content to relevant subreddits**\n\n* r/dogfree operates alongside a couple sister subs.\n\n* Humor-related posts should be redirected to r/dogfreehumor.\n\n* For those those unwillingly living with dogs owned by others, whether it be a significant other, parents, extended family, or a roommate, or for those in a serious relationship, live-in or otherwise, dominated by a dog, please use /r/TalesFromTheDoghouse.\n\n###**No Crossposts**\n* Crossposts are not allowed. \n* Criticisms of other subreddits and or their users are off-topic.\n* Mentions of other subreddits are not allowed.\n\n###**No Soliciting**\n* No soliciting or self-promotion. This includes but is not limited to goods, services, content, online forums, crowdfunding, or recruitment efforts.\n\n###**Moderators Have Discretion**\n* This is a community for those who do not like or own dogs to discuss modern-day dog ownership and its effects on society. Conversation should stay on topic.\n\n* Cats, other pets, childbearing choices, politics, religion, and bestiality, among other subjects, are generally off topic and beyond the scope of the sub.\n\n* Mods are committed to making all decisions in the best interest of our sub, so we reserve the right to restrict topics/remove content deemed off topic or otherwise not constructive. \n\n###**No Self Defense Discussion**\n* Self defense posts and comments, both hypothetical or otherwise are not permitted in this subreddit, even if it is legal in your locale.

    "description": "Our furry little friends are likely to develop dental disease if their dental needs are ignored. Periodontal disease is not uncommon among dogs, particularly small dog breeds. And just like with humans, these problems can result in bad breath, yellowed teeth, and in the worst of cases, even progress to loss of teeth.\nThe development of such problems usually begins with such signs as swollen, red, and painful gums. Your pet may have less of an appetite as well. These signs indicate a need for immediate professional care.\n\nTooth decay and/or the loss of teeth usually indicate the presence of bacteria in the mouth. If left untreated the damage can progress from only involving the mouth to further damage that can include serious complications related to the kidneys, lungs, and heart, all of which can lead to a shortened lifespan. Periodontal problems usually start with the formation of plaque.\n\n Plaque builds on the teeth and in thirty-six hours or less, plaque can harden and tartar can form. This problem usually develops first and the worst in the upper back teeth. Unfortunately, once tartar has formed, it cannot be brushed away.\n\nThe good news is that these problems can be avoided. Although healthy routines can be started with any dog at any age, it is always best to start healthy routines with a young puppy. If the dog is older you should insure that he has a professional dental cleaning and then begin the healthy dental routine at home.\n\n\nAt first the dog will wonder what you are doing so it is best to allow him to taste the doggie toothpaste. These special pastes are formulated to be appealing to dogs. You can use your finger or a special dog toothbrush. Don\u2019t forget to clean both the teeth and the gums. Begin in the back and work in small circular motions. The entire brushing process will take less than a minute.See more....\n\nWebsite:http://nicepets4you.weebly.com/\nAuther:Fazal Zubair\n",

    "description": "DogInventions is an experiment in design for people to come together to create everyday items from the perspective that dogs rule the world and humans don't exist.  \n\nPost anything from a pencil sketch of a bicycle designed to fit a dog, to a 3D printed model of a vacuum made for use by a dog.  The sky is the limit.  You don't have to be a master artist, this is meant to be fun for everyone.\n\n**What this place IS**:  A place for people to get creative and come up with clever solutions to dog problems.  To design functional solutions to everyday things such that they fit the size, shape and motor skills of a dog.   Imagine that humans did not exist- what would the world look like if everything was designed for dogs?\n\n**What it is NOT**: A place to post funny pictures of dogs doing human things, or dogs owning their humans.  \n\nContent would be something along the lines of the following:\n\n* Drawing/sketching\n* MS Paint/Photoshop (a little effort please)\n* 3D modeling/SketchUp\n* Painting\n* 3D Printing\n* CAD\n* Sculpting\n* Anything else!\n\n**Original content is encouraged** but not required. \n\nIf you've actually created something in real life specifically designed and optimized for dog use, that's more than welcome too!\n\n---\n\nThis subreddit was created without much of a plan and has no style yet.  Bear with me.  \n\n---\n\n**Rules**:\n\n* No spam/product posts .. this isn't a place to peddle your wares.  Some clever, highly functional product posts can be considered as long as they fit the theme of the subreddit.\n* No pics/gifs of dogs using unmodified human things ([example](http://i.imgur.com/jnQzcx4.jpg)), as that goes against the concept of the subreddit.\n\n",

Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* \n * Do not post GIFs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to GIF formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. \n\n **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  \n **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**\n\n Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.\n\n2. **No Reaction, Meme, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote GIFs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)\n\n3. **Do not post GIFs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, subtitles, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the GIF).  **Duration must be twenty seconds or less.  \u2020**\n\n4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single GIF image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!\n\n5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.\n\n6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. \n\n7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqu\u00e9 posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)\n\n8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/wiki/rule9)\n\n10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.\n\n**\u2020 We may allow multiple cuts and/or GIFs up to a minute long depending on the popularity of a post.

We welcome pictures, discussions, questions/advice.\n\n**2.** We prefer that if you post photos, it be of your own cat(s) or one(s) you personally know. If clearly stated, photos of cat(s) you don't know are allowed, within reason. **Lying and claiming/posting someone else's cat is/as your own will result in an immediate ban, with no warnings given.**\n\n**3.** No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty. No Death: While we understand you may be mourning, please do not share photos of deceased cats. Pictures of your lost pets when they were still alive are fine. \n\nWe understand that hunting is a natural behavior but ask that you don't share photos of your cat's prize here.\n\n\n**4.** No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. \"This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww\", \"it's my cake day\", \"my first post here\", \"any love for ...\").\n\n**5.** Absolutely no fundraising, crowdfunding, competitions, or advertisements allowed. This includes any links asking for donations or competition votes. (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative).\n\n**6.** Don't be insulting, harassing, or creepy. Be civil. We have a strong, bright-line policy against insults, name-calling, or harassment, and will ban you without notice for such conduct. This is a global subreddit welcoming content from all cultures. Please remember that this includes that you may not tell people to \"keep their cats indoors\".  **If a photo has a person in it along with a cat, don't even think of being creepy or rude to that person. This includes any comments on people's appearance, either positive or negative!**\n\n**7.** Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back).\n\n**8.** No meme, image macro, low-effort content. No AI-generated content. Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content. You might want to check out r/MEOW_IRL and r/Catmemes for that.\n\n**9.** Recent/Egregious reposts: Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma.\n\n**10.** Reposts are allowed (and crossposts are too, don't confuse them!), within reason.\n\n**11.** No posts asking what gender your cat is, ask a vet!\n\n**12.** 'Name my cat/kitten' posts are allowed, but **require** the correct flair + verification to ensure OC. You **must** set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule. Please submit your post **before** sending us a mod mail - your submission will trigger an automated message that will contain the instructions required for your post to be approved. Your verification message will be left **unanswered** if you send us a mod mail before you have submitted your post for us to review.\n\n**13.** No politically motivated posts. This includes pictures of politicians (of any country) with their cats and pictures/videos of people in war-torn areas saving cats.

Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. An opinion. One opinion. A subjective statement about your position on some topic. Please have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way.\n\n* Your opinion must be unpopular. Unpopularity is a bit like an onion. It has layers. Be specific as to where you believe your opinion is unpopular.\n\nRule 2: **Do not post low effort/satirical/troll posts.**\n\n* We get it, you all think this sub is garbage and is just for popular opinions, and you want to be funny and post \"going to be downvoted to oblivion here, but I think racism is bad.\" We enjoy the memes, but please keep them off the sub.\n\n* Filter evasion is a banable offense\n\n* If your post is just one sentence it will be removed. Please try and elaborate on your opinion and justify your position.\n\n* Any opinion that is not well thought out, incoherent, internally contradictory or otherwise nonsensical is subject to removal.\n\nRule 3: **Do not post opinions that are heavily posted/have been on the front page recently.**\n\n* Recent reposts are not allowed.\n\n* Opinions that are constantly posted here are not allowed.\n\n* Posts relating to highly popular topics aren't allowed outside of the relevant megathreads. You can find a list of the topics and their respective megathreads in a post on the top of the sub.\n\n* POSTS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT ARE NOT ALLOWED. No, this isn't censoring criticism, they're just overposted. If you have a meta opinion, put it in the megathread.\n\n* We ask that if a post fails to post do not just spam repost it; message mod mail.\n\nRule 4: **Be Civil.**\n\n* This applies for both your behaviour on the sub, and the opinions which you post.\n\n* Obey the sitewide rules and [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette).\n\n* No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or general bigotry.\n\n* Some opinions are so inappropriate/offensive that they'll be removed as hate posts. These posts are usually, but not exclusively, those that target a particular sex, race, sexual orientation, etc, when the user in question is hostile, vulgar or aggressive towards said group.\n\nRule 5: **No Political Posts.**\n\n* Our users have voted for no political posts in this sub, and this rule will not be changed until the majority votes otherwise. \n\n* It's very unlikely your political post is an unpopular opinion. Feel free to use the Politics Megathread pinned to the front page. Our civility rules apply at all times.\n\n\nRule 6.\n**No r/self style posts**\n\n* Please refrain from posting anything that resembles an r/self-style post.\n\n* This is not the subreddit to be sharing personal anecdotes, likes or dislikes. We want unpopular, thought provoking, and unique opinions on your chosen topic.\n\n7.\n**No Banned/Mega-Thread topics**\n\n* Please do not post from (or mention) any of our mega-thread or banned topics such as:\n\n* Race, Religion, LGBTQ, Meta, Politics, Parenting/Family issues.",

You could buy a cup of coffee without waiting till the shop closes for a confirmation, and also without paying anything close to the cost of the coffee in fees.  \n\nWidely accepted on exchanges; a great tool to move between other crypto-currencies and fiat FAST while keeping fees low. (Try doing that with ANY other coin, they either don\u2019t have the stability, reputation, volume or their fees are CONSIDERABLY higher)  \n\nOne of the oldest, well established, tried and true crypto-currencies, There have been considerable ups and downs in the value of the coin in comparison to fiat and other coins however it has stood the test of time and is still widely accepted and has remained a useful tool regardless of its exchange rate. (Which is why you will see 1 Doge = 1 Doge used frequently)\n  \nStrong positive community. Projects that show humanity, kindness, generosity. Among an ocean of get rich quick schemes, scams, pumps and dumps, this is the only coin which has a community centered on the positive things that crypto-currency can do  \n\n---\n\n**Dogecoin price ticker:**  `\u01101 = \u01101`\n***\n\n---\n\n**General Rules:**\n\n**0.** Be excellent to each other. \n\n**1.** Follow [reddit's content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) \n\n**2.** Discrimination against other shibes will not be tolerated\n\n**3.** Follow [REDDIQUETTE](/wiki/reddiquette) and [DOGECOINRULES](/r/dogecoin/wiki/dogecoinrules) at all times\n\n**4.** Don't use /r/dogecoin to [beg](/r/dogecoin/wiki/begging) sell or buy your personal items. \n\n**5.** NO [Trolling.](/r/dogecoin/wiki/trolling) [It's annoying](http://goo.gl/PGd7Cp)\n\n**6.** Swearing is automagiclly removed. \n\n**7.** No promotion of [adult content](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/wiki/adultcontent) allowed\n\n**8.** Don't [spam](/r/dogecoin/wiki/spam)\n\n**9.** Don't post/comment referral links or scams including pump and dumps\n\n**10.** Please leave politics, religion and other divisive discussions at the door.\n\n**11.** Don't repost recently posted content or karma farm\n\n**12.** If you need an exception from a rule for a specific reason send a message to the mods to discuss. \n\n[](https://dogecoinfah.com)\n\n\n***\n*Hover to show*\n\n###\u25c4 Moderation of this subreddit\n\n1.

If there is a person and an animal, the animal doesn't need to be a pet). All friends must be over 16 at the time of the photo.\n+ Tasteful nudity only for adults. No bare skin for kids. Absolutely no NSFW for anyone under the age of 18. Proof of age may be required.

If there are bars around your photo, it will be rejected.\n+ Fake gore only. Nothing real or too realistic to tell it's fake.\n\n##Rules for artists\n\n+ Your artwork must contain recognizable components from the photo\n+ Your artwork must be a serious attempt. If art that distorts features is reported, it will be reviewed and potentially removed.\n+ Your artwork cannot be a filter/photo manipulation/AI made\n+ Your art mustn\u2019t add nudity/sexualisation\n+ Your post must contain artwork relevant to that photo only. Do not link to collages unless it is all of one person.\n+ You cannot request compensation in comments or PMs. Adding a tip jar or small donation link is fine as long as you are not demanding payment for your art.\n+ Please do not delete your artwork after you post it.\n\n##Our Subreddit Friends\n\n[RDGArt](https://www.reddit.com/r/RGDArt) - **RGD Sister sub for art posts and discussions**\n\n[RedditGetsDrawings (**Not affiliated with RGD**)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditGetsDrawings/)\n\n[Artist Lounge](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/)\n\n[Add On](http://www.reddit.com/r/addon)\n\n[Adorable Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/adorableart)\n\n[Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/art)\n\n[Art Crit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtCrit)\n\n[Art History](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtHistory)\n\n[Art Porn](http://www.reddit.com/r/artporn)\n\n[Art Progress Pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtProgressPics)\n\n[ArtistMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/artistmemes/)\n\n[Anime Sketch](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeSketch)\n\n[Caricatures](http://www.reddit.com/r/Caricatures)\n\n[CasualDraw](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualDraw)\n\n[Comic Book Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookart)\n\n[DeviantArt](http://www.reddit.com/r/deviantart)\n\n[Draw Me NSFW](https://www.reddit.com/r/drawmeNSFW)\n\n[Drawing](http://www.reddit.com/r/drawing)\n\n[Drawings Revisited](http://www.reddit.com/r/drawingsrevisited)\n\n[Erotic Art](https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotic_Art)\n\n[I Can Draw That](http://www.reddit.com/r/icandrawthat)\n\n[IDAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/idap)\n\n[Learn Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart)\n\n[Learn To Draw](https://www.reddit.com/r/learntodraw/)\n\n[Minimalist Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalist_art)\n\n[NSFW Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/NSFWart) \n\n[Photoshop Battles](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles)\n\n[Random Acts of Drawing](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofdrawing)\n\n[Sketchdaily](http://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily)\n\n[Us As Anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/usasanime)\n\n[Watercolor101](http://reddit.com/r/watercolor101)\n\n[InterstellarArt](http://reddit.com//r/InterstellarArt)\n\n[ArtifyMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtifyMemes/)\n\n[ArtOilPainting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Artoilpainting/)\n\n[Original Painting](https://www.reddit.com/r/originalpainting)",

All questions are allowed, including those that are not specifically about your pet (i.e. preparing for vet school, general animal husbandry questions).\n\n**If you want to answer questions in this sub, please review and follow [The Sub Rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/about/rules/)**\n\nWe are not here to diagnose your pet or tell you specifically how he/she should be treated, but as a second source of information. \n\nWe will not give opinions on whether or not another veterinarian is treating your animal correctly or incorrectly.\n\nIf you are a veterinary professional (veterinarian, technician, student, etc.) and have non-medical questions, /r/veterinaryprofession would be a better sub to post on. \n\n---\n\n**WHAT NOT TO POST**\n\nGiving OP specific instructions on medications and dosages is both unethical and illegal without an existing doctor-patient relationship. Such posts will be deleted, and repeat violators will be banned.\n\nAnswers involving [anecdotes about your own pets](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/36iy7o/meta_a_reminder_anecdotes_are_not_acceptable) are not usually appropriate in this sub and may be removed at the mods' discretion.

Example: \"We'll call my friend F, her mom FM, and Kevin K\". These are very difficult to read and unless you are a Kevin you know how to tell a story using names  \n\n**Please avoid these:**  \n - One-liners.  Elaborate past a single sentence to make your story more interesting.  \n - Stories about people who annoy you for reasons other than stupidity.  Your friend who kills the mood, your rude coworker, your roommate who won't do the dishes, etc.  \n***These posts may be allowed if they are interesting enough, and will be flaired with the more appropriate subreddit.***\n\n---\n\n**What is a Kevin?**\n\nA Kevin is someone who consistently or greatly shows a complete lack of intelligence through incompetence of social and societal norms, or is purposefully antagonistic in their poor decision making. Remember the kid in your class who would constantly get in trouble for really dumb things? He was probably a Kevin. Family members, friends, coworkers, and classmates can all become Kevins.\n\n**So, what DOESN'T qualify as a Kevin?**\n\nAnyone who makes small, understandable mistakes, is not a Kevin. If they misspell a word, or make a simple mistake, they are not a Kevin. They dropped something? Not a Kevin.\n\n**How should I format my post/What stories should I tell?**\n\nMultiple short stories per post are encouraged, but if the level of severity is high enough, one longer story is fine. If you view the top posts of the subreddit, you can find several good examples of the content that is expected on the subreddit.\n\n**What should I do if I see a post that isn't Kevin-ish enough?**\n\nReport the post. We will review it, and likely remove it if it does not fit the Kevin guidelines.  If so, it may be flaired with the appropriate sub or the reason for removal.  \n\n---\n\n**Subreddits You May Also Like**  \n/r/TIFU: when you do something really stupid  \n/r/rant  \n/r/TalesFromTechSupport  \n/r/TailsFromRetail  \n/r/IDontWorkHereLady  \n/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy  \n/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk   \n/r/RealLifeLegends",
