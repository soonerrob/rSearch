# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001: Maintaining Synchronous Architecture for Reddit Operations

### Status
Accepted

### Context
- The application uses PRAW for Reddit operations in a synchronous manner
- FastAPI endpoints are async
- Background tasks use threading for periodic updates
- Database operations use SQLAlchemy synchronously
- Current system shows stable performance with good caching (60s cache hits)
- Background tasks complete reliably on hourly cycles

### Consideration
While AsyncPRAW exists and is recommended, transitioning would require:
1. Complete rework of background task system
2. Restructuring all Reddit API calls
3. Modification of database transaction patterns
4. Changes to theme processing pipeline
5. Potential frontend data consistency impacts

### Decision
Maintain current synchronous architecture because:
1. System demonstrates stable performance
2. Database caching is effective
3. Background tasks complete reliably
4. Frontend response times are acceptable
5. No current performance bottlenecks observed

### Consequences
Positive:
- Maintains system stability
- Preserves working background task model
- Keeps simple transaction management
- Retains proven caching benefits

Negative:
- Not utilizing potential async performance benefits
- Technical debt in terms of modern async patterns
- May need revisiting if scale increases significantly

### Future Considerations
Consider AsyncPRAW migration when:
1. Planning major version upgrade
2. Experiencing Reddit API bottlenecks
3. Requiring significant scale increase
4. Implementing system-wide async architecture

### Migration Prerequisites
If future migration is needed:
1. Comprehensive test suite for Reddit operations
2. Staging environment for parallel testing
3. Background task framework that supports async
4. Clear rollback strategy
5. Frontend resilience to data inconsistencies
