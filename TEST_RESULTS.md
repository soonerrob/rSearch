     - Should retain posts as pythonprojects2 still exists in audience 12
     - Blocked by frontend deletion issue
   - Next Test Planned:
     - Remove pythonprojects2 from audience 12
     - Verify all posts are deleted as it's the last reference

3. Database Verification
   - Pre-deletion State:
     - 500 posts for pythonprojects2
     - Posts referenced in both audiences 9 and 12
     - All theme associations intact
   - Verification Points:
     - [ ] Posts retained after audience 9 deletion
     - [ ] Theme posts properly cleaned up
     - [ ] Posts only deleted when removed from audience 12

### Current Blocker
- Unable to verify post retention logic due to audience deletion issue
- Need to resolve frontend/backend communication issue first
- Post retention logic implementation appears correct in code review

### Next Steps
1. Resolve audience deletion issue
2. Verify post retention during audience 9 deletion
3. Test complete cleanup when removing from audience 12
4. Document final post retention behavior
