\N	bitcoin	Bitcoin	Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*.\n\nIf you are new to Bitcoin, check out [We Use Coins](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/) and [Bitcoin.org](https://www.bitcoin.org/). You can also explore the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page):\n\n* **[Don't invest recklessly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/)**  \n* [Getting Started](https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started)  \n* [FAQ / Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq)\n* [Resources](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html)\n* [Common Myths](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths)  \n* **[How to buy bitcoins worldwide](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/)**  \n* [Bitcoin as a medium of exchange](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_as_a_medium_of_exchange)\n* [Will I earn money by mining bitcoin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18r5qc/will_i_earn_money_by_mining_an_answer_to_all/)  \n* [Bitcoin as an investment](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_as_an_investment)\n* [Storing Bitcoins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins)\n* [Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/)\n* [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)\n\n###Community guidelines\n\n* Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.\n* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.\n* News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.\n* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.\n* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.\n* No referral links in submissions.\n* No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.\n* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 0.2 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.\n* Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from *new* merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider [Reddit's self-serve advertising system](https://ads.reddit.com).\n* Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to.\n* Be aware that X, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are full of impersonation.\n* Do not post about altcoins and do not post off-topic political spam.\n\n\n###Related communities\n\n^(Sorted roughly by decreasing popularity.)\n\n* **[Bitcoin Beginners](/r/bitcoinbeginners)**\n* [Local Bitcoin communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/local_communities)\n* [TheLightningNetwork](/r/TheLightningNetwork)\n* [BitcoinMarkets](/r/BitcoinMarkets)\n* [BitcoinMining](/r/bitcoinmining)\n* [BitcoinTaxes](/r/bitcointaxes) [[CryptoTax](/r/CryptoTax)]\n* [BitMarket](/r/BitMarket)\n* [Jobs4Bitcoin] (/r/Jobs4bitcoins)\n* [BitcoinDiscussion](/r/BitcoinDiscussion)\n* [BitcoinTechnology](/r/BitcoinTechnology)\n* [Best of Crypto] (/r/Best_of_Crypto)\n* [[More]] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/communities)\n\n^(Non-Bitcoin communities)\n\n* [Technology](/r/technology)\n* [Economics](/r/economics)\n* [Crypto](/r/crypto)\n* [Anarcho-Capitalism](/r/Anarcho_Capitalism)\n* [CryptoAnarchy](/r/cryptoanarchy)\n* [[More]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/communities)\n\n###Join us on IRC\n\n[web.libera.chat *#bitcoin*](irc://irc.libera.chat/bitcoin)\n\n###Other Bitcoin sites\n\n**[Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org)**  \n[Bitcoin Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/)  \n[Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/)\n\n###Download Bitcoin Core\n\n[**Bitcoin Core**](https://bitcoincore.org/en/blog/) is the [backbone of the Bitcoin network](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node).

\N	prequelmemes	PrequelMemes	*Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who “started it” when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. "Prequel" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. "Just a picture of Obi-Wan") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn’t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don’t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn’t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the “I love democracy” macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.	3767175	195	15.614692992364342	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:14:56.139217	2016-12-26 21:05:47-06	2025-03-14 01:14:56.139102-05

If the article is in Korean, provide a full English translation or a detailed summary in the comments at the time of posting. Machine translations not permitted.\n\n##### 4.   No Reposts / Throwbacks / Old Media\n* Only content released within the last 30 days is allowed. Make sure that the content submission has not been posted already (No Reposts!). Throwback posts are curated by moderators on Thursdays.\n\n##### 5.   Avoid Piracy\n* Link to officially licensed sources as often as possible. Pirated content will be removed if an official source becomes available or is likely to in the future. Any media that is obviously behind a paywall or exclusive to people who have paid/subscribed to a service are not allowed.\n\n##### 6.   Only In-Depth Discussions\n* Discussion posts should be based on interesting or novel topics that are conversation starters. They should allow for broad participation from the community and include significant content in the original post beyond just asking a question. Mods may use discretion to allow simpler questions if they are novel/unique or are especially topical at the time.\n\n##### 7.   No Ranting or Soapbox Posts\n* Do not use the subreddit as a platform to rant about your personal opinion on an issue. You may rant *respectfully* and start more opinionated or artist-centered discussions in r/kpoppers. Topics designed to bash artists or their fans are absolutely not allowed.\n\n##### 8.   No Memes or Joke Posts\n* Content submitted with the intention of being humorous is restricted to the Weekly Discussion post or r/kpoppers.\n\n##### 9.   No Fan-Made Content / Self-Promo\n* Fan-made content is restricted to r/kpoppers. For a list of allowed content, read the r/kpop ecosystem guidelines. Do not link to your own blogs, articles, or work in r/kpop. Official company/artist accounts should seek permission from the moderators before posting. \n\n#####10.   No Buying / Selling\n* Submissions offering to buy/sell/trade merchandise or concert tickets are better suited for r/kpopforsale. We do not have affiliation with that subreddit, so use it at your own risk.\n\n\n\n>[Questions?

\N	30plusskincare	30PlusSkinCare	Some basic rules:\n\n1. Please don't post here if you aren't yet 30 - we will be removing posts from people under 30. r/SkincareAddiction has a fantastic list of the other subs on Reddit where you will be talking to your peers: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/related_subs\n\n2. We can't (and don't) offer medical advice. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your health. Your post will be removed for asking about medical conditions (for example: a photo and "What is this?)\n\n3. No spam, self-promotion, direct product links or consumer surveys! If you would like to recommend a product, you may link it within a text post. Also, do not self-promote your app, blog, you tube reviews, cosmetic services etc. Please don't use this group for surveys or consumer research.  If you are doing academic research and would like to ask for permission to post about your study, YOU MUST contact the moderation team before doing so.\n\n4. Discussion of cosmetic surgeries / enhancements / treatments is totally cool here. \n\n5. Selfies are not allowed EXCEPT on Selfie Sundays.  If you are posting to ask questions about a particular area of your face, you must edit your photo so it is clear what you are concerned about, either by cropping the photo or by blocking out features you are NOT asking about.  \n\n6. Be nice. Constructive criticism is cool, but acting like an ass is not. And do NOT post things like "How old do you think I look / am" as that never goes well. \n\n7. If you are shilling for a MLM company, you will be banned. Please see r/antiMLM if you want to know why.\n\n8.

\N	btc	btc	Welcome to /r/btc! \n\nWhen r/Bitcoin moderators began censoring content and banning users they disagreed with, r/btc became a community for free and open crypto discussion. This happened long before the creation of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nOver the years /r/btc became community of historians & torchbearers, preservers of Satoshi's Bitcoin for future generations. In this place you can learn what "Bitcoin" means and what it truly represents. \n\nBitcoin is the *currency of the Internet*. A distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever.\n\nThere is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, *you can be your own bank*. [Read the original Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto.](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)\n\nWe welcome free and open Bitcoin-related discussion, Bitcoin news, and exclusive AMA (Ask Me Anything) interviews from top Bitcoin and cryptocurrency leaders.

\N	crypto	crypto	#Cryptography \n... is the art of creating mathematical / information theoretic assurances for who can do what with data, including but not limited to the classical example of encrypting messages so that only the key-holder can read it. Cryptography lives at an intersection of [math](/r/math) and [computer science](/r/compsci).\n\nThis subreddit is intended for links and discussions surrounding the theory and practice of modern and *strong* cryptography.\n\n**Please note that this subreddit focused on the tech, not politics!** The focus is on the algorithms and the security of the implementations. \n\n---\n\n####**Want to join?**\nBecause this subreddit currently is in restricted mode, you will NOT be able to post or comment before your account has been approved.

The rules listed there are also used as this sub's report reasons. The quick version;\n\n* Assume good faith and be kind. This is a friendly subreddit.\n* Using any AI / LLM without disclosing it is prohibited. You MUST inform us if you used one, AND share the prompt. They are frequently wrong and we must be able to distinguish the true source\n* Codes, simple ciphers, ARGs, and other such "weak crypto" don't belong here. (Rule of thumb: If a desktop computer can break a code in less than an hour, it's not strong crypto.) You're probably looking for /r/codes.\n* Do not ask people to break your cryptosystem without first sharing the algorithm. [Sharing just the output is like...](/r/crypto/comments/1boxkg/-/c98x4ej)\n* "Crack this cipher" challenges also belong in /r/codes *unless* they're based on interesting crypto implementation bugs, e.g. weak RSA keys.\n* Familiarize yourself with the following before posting a question about a novel cryptosystem, or else the risk is nobody will take their time to answer: \n  * [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)\n  * [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html)\n* Don't use this sub to cheat on competitions or challenges! You're expected to solve such problems yourself. You may ask for help to understand it, but you should disclose the source. \n* Systems that *use* crypto are not necessarily relevant here, e.g. Bitcoin. Maybe try /r/cryptocurrency? Political news also very rarely belong here. See the list of related subs below for alternatives. Remember that this sub is focused on the algorithms, and isn't political. \n\n---\n\n###RESOURCES \n\nInternal:\n\n* [Our wiki pages](/r/crypto/wiki)  \n* Threads on starting in crypto [one](/r/crypto/comments/hnze6) & [two](/r/crypto/comments/3izwdo)\n* Thread of [crypto links](/r/crypto/comments/2jw4yo) - [older thread](/r/crypto/comments/ih1z3)\n* Our [monthly cryptography wishlist threads!](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/search?q=wishlist+thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new) \n* Our [hiring threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/search?q=Hiring+thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new) \n\nExternal:\n\n* [Lemmy cryptography forum - affiliated](https://infosec.pub/c/crypto)\n* [Cryptology ePrint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/) \n* [Discussion site for ePrint papers](https://askcryp.to/) \n* [Libera Chat's IRC:s #crypto](https://web.libera.chat/?nick=redditor?#crypto) - ([IRC protocol URL](irc://irc.libera.chat/%23crypto)\\) \n* [Metzdowd cryptography mailing list](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/) \n* [Randombit cryptography mailing list](https://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/)\n* [StackExchange cryptography community](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/) \n\n**Other subreddits that may be of interest:**\n\nRelated:\n\n* /r/cryptography \n* /r/encryption \n* /r/weboftrust (fairly empty)\n* /r/capabilities - A type of security model\n* /r/Intelligence - Espionage\n\nTheory:\n\n* /r/algorithms\n* /r/mathematics, /r/math\n\nPractical:\n\n* /r/netsec - Network Security\n* /r/RNG - Randomness generation\n* /r/compsec - Local computer security\n* /r/websec - Security in the browser\n* /r/security - General security subreddit \n* /r/privacy - General privacy subreddit \n* /r/compsci & /r/ComputerScience - Development and application of algorithms \n\nEducational, hobbyist:\n\n* /r/codes & /r/breakmycode - For cracking basic codes\n* /r/gpgpractice - Learn to use GPG here\n* /r/primitiveplayground - test your homebrew ciphers here\n* /r/stanfordcrypto\n\nPolitical and in the news:\n\n* /r/privacypatriots/\n* /r/NSAleaks - Snowden documents and more \n* /r/restorethefourth\n\nSoftware:\n\n* /r/gpg (fairly empty)\n* /r/bitcoin, /r/cryptocurrency - crypto applied to money\n\nMemes and low effort submissions:\n\n* /r/shittycrypto\n\n---\n\nFeel free to message the moderators with suggestions for how to improve this subreddit, as well as for requesting adding links in the sidebar.	323053	176	1.905317622401772	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:14:48.376617	2008-12-18 13:20:10-06	2025-03-14 01:14:48.376382-05

In a lifetime, you are more likely to die from fireworks, lightning, drowning, a car accident, stroke, or heart disease.\n\n* For every human killed by a shark, humans kill approximately **two million sharks.**\n\n****\n*Citations*\n[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark#Taxonomy), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark#Popular_misconceptions), [3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark#Evolution), [4](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Sharks/Statistics/beachattacks.htm), [5](http://www.goshark.co.za/1/all/all/all)\n\n### Rules\n* **DO NOT submit posts or comments that PROMOTE or ADVERTISE the following:**\n* Shark fishing, culling, or poaching\n* Photos that exhibit sharks in unnatural environments. \n* An extinct species (Megaladon) is extant\n\n## Related Subreddits:\n\n> /r/awwducational\n\n> /r/conservation\n\n> /r/fossilid\n\n> /r/lifeaquatic\n\n>/r/marinebiology\n\n> /r/oceans\n\n> /r/OceanLife\n\n> /r/scuba\n\n>/r/Shark_Attacks  \n\n> /r/seacreatureporn (SFW)\n\n> /r/sharksporn (SFW)\n\n> /r/species\n\n> /r/whales\n\n> /r/WhaleSharks\n\n\n\n\n\n## Resources:\n\n>[Keys to Shark identification](http://www.bio.gc.ca/sharks/identity-identite-eng.php)\n\n>[Identifying Shark Teeth](https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/fossils/identificationguide.html)\n\n>[International Shark Attack File 2014](https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/isaf/2014Summary.html)	230204	25	5.072863702016229	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:15:46.857025	2010-01-18 06:20:07-06	2025-03-14 01:15:46.856896-05

\N	izlam	Izlam	###### [](#h6-red)\n> #[Remember](#icon-exclamation)\n> The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Most things posted are exaggerations of a Muslim's day to day life.\n\n>#Discord /r/Izlam Server \n\n> Join your brozers and sizters in our Izlam discord server for quality memes and jokes. https://discord.gg/Uta5eH8w4h\n### [](#h3-Blue)\n\n#####[](#h5-yellow)\n>#RULES:\n\n>**1. Be Civil:** This is a Muslim run subreddit, maintain good adab (manners/character). Don't swear. Treat everyone well, Muslim or otherwise. \n\n>**2. All Posts Must Be Islam Related:** Just because something is funny doesn't necessarily make it Islam-related. Additionally, Arabic =/= Islamic. Memes about parents being strict =/= Islamic. Islam and culture are very different things. So much so that if your post implies that "white people" can't be or are not Muslim, then it will be removed.\n\n>**3. No rebosts:** It is disliked to repost memes on this subreddit especially if your intention is to milk some karma out of it. Reposting for the sake of the meta is a different issue which the mods will have to decide whether to keep up the post or not.\n\n>**4. No Screenshots from MEMRI TV:** Without this rule, we get flooded with their posts.\n\n>**5. No NSFW Content:** This is not a NSFW subreddit, so think real hard before posting anything inappropriate. Most, if not all, get removed, and you will be permanently banned.\n\n>**6. No Shia/Sunni/other hate:** There's a difference between satire and insults and some jokes placed find themselves entering a realm of hate for certain beliefs in Islam. Whether you're Muslim or not, this sub is not meant to be antagonistic to Muslims, so any posts or comments that seem to attack Muslims will be removed and put the user at the risk of a ban. This includes beliefs that you don't agree with. \n\n>**7. No Blasphemy:** In efforts to remain a halal form of humor, we are not allowing blasphemy on this sub.\n\n>Mocking God - ban\n\n>Mocking His prophets - ban\n\n>Mocking His book - ban\n\n>Mocking the angels - ban\n\n>Mocking Islam - ban\n\n>Facetious remarks regarding these could lead to a BAN\n\n>Simply depicting these things could lead to a BAN\n\n>Note: although depicting shaytan and jinn is not classified as blasphemy, we will also be removing posts including depictions of them\n\n>**8. Translate everything you post:** If you post something in Arabic, llama, or any language, always translate it to English. We have a number of members of this sub that would enjoy your content, but simply don't understand it. Not following this rule makes your post subject to removal.\n\n\n>**9. No Debating!** This is hardly the place for a real debate about Islamic jurisprudence. Or anything, really. Too many people are trolling for you to get any accurate information from most posters here. We recommend heading to /r/islam or /r/Shia if you have questions pertaining to actual Islam. Even inciting a debate could potentially lead to a ban. Don't debate.\n\n>**10. No Identifying Info Posts or Brigading:** Don't target any subs and downvote or otherwise attack them for whatever reason. When posting to other subs, either cross-post or create a no participation post. If anyone's username is in a submission that could potentially lead to this sub upvoting or downvoting them en masse, the post will be removed. This applies to any form of social media or post. Always block out identifying information, whether it's a real name or username.\n\n\n#### [](#h4-green)\n>##[Giving dawah to:](#icon-check)\n\n>/r/islam \n\n>/r/MuslimLounge \n\n>/r/Muslim\n\n>/r/IslamicQuotes\n\n>r/MuslimFamilySolutions\n\n>/r/Muslim \n\n######[New comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Izlam/comments/) ~~|~~ [About /r/Izlam](http://redd.it/2f4d94) ~~|~~	145853	4	1.102639954873439	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:15:34.317347	2014-08-23 06:16:48-05	2025-03-14 01:15:34.317157-05

If your post doesn't directly have anything to do with those two categories, it could possibly get removed. Misleading or clickbait titles, troll posts, or shitposts are subject to removal. Use the filters if you don't want to see a certain kind of post. If you are unsure whether or not your post will get removed, please message the mods and we will try to answer as soon as possible.**\n\n##Subreddit Rules\n\n1\\. **Discussion is the goal** - All posts must be directly novel related, informative, and discussion focused. This can be about a scene from a web novel you particularly liked/disliked, the novel as a whole, or issues related to the community.\n\n2\\. **Recommendation Requests** - Requests for personalized recommendations or suggestions are not allowed. Post instead to our Weekly Recommendation Thread (stickied at the top of the 'HOT' page and also accessible through the subreddit's nav menu or through the buttons on the sidebar widget )\n\nPosts asking users to list their favorite/the best book of a genre, style, etc that don't include an answer and why in the body will be assumed to be recommendation requests and removed.\n\n3\\. **Don't be an asshole** - We understand that many of you are angry about your generally pathetic lives. Do not bring that into the subreddit or the community. Do not enter a discussion with the intent to "prove" that you are the superior being. None of you are. Just be chill.\n\n\n4\\. **Toxic Reader Behavior** - The wonderful web novels that we talk about and share with each other here are translated and produced through the hard work of REAL PEOPLE. The translators and editors who work on these novels spend hours of the their free time translating these novels for you guys. Do not be assholes, or we won't have any novels to read.\n\nComments like: "Translation too slow" when chapters release several times a week or "I only read after 200+ chapters" will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n\n5\\. **No Platform-based Hate.** - This subreddit is for discussion on web novels and their intrinsic qualities. Not about the platform they are posted on, the various business dealings of the players in the industry or any thing of that nature. How other people conduct their business and relationships is of no consequence here. Do not attempt to create drama regarding platforms. Do not promote hate for a novel based on where it's published.\n\nOne warning. Any violations of this rule after that will result in a ban.\n \n6\\. **Do Not Post Links To Aggregators** - Many of the web novels here are made freely available to everyone to read. Aggregators steal free content to make advertising revenue. Do not send people to read on an aggregator website. Do not recommend an aggregator website. Use NovelUpdates to find the official source for any web novel.\n\nShould the novel be paywalled, do not recommend an aggregator. We do not stand for or encourage piracy on this subreddit.\n\nThis is a zero tolerance rule. All offenders will be banned. No ignorance excuse.\n\n7\\. **Spoilers** - If you do not mark your post or comment as having spoilers it will be removed. Any posts with a spoiler in the title will be removed.\n\nSpoiler tags in comments are done like the example below if you are using markdown or use the built-in spoiler tags on the redesign.\n\nHow to spoiler tag: >(#)!spoiler here!(#)< remove the (#) and this appears as <!spoiler here!>.\n\n8\\. **Inappropriate Content** - This isn't a NSFW subreddit. Don't post that stuff here. Posts will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banne\n\n###[Message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnoveltranslations)\n\n##Wiki\n\n* **Our wiki contains additional details and other random things.

\N	shamanism	Shamanism	[Shamanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism) is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to encounter and interact with the spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.  \n  \nA shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, a person who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.\n\nThere are many variations of shamanism throughout the world, but several common beliefs are shared by all forms of Shamanism. Common beliefs identified by [Eliade](https://www.singingtotheplants.com/2007/12/eliades-shamanism/) are the following:\n\n* Spirits exist and they play important roles both in individual lives and in human society.\n* The Shaman can communicate with the spirit world.\n* Spirits can be benevolent or malevolent.\n* The Shaman can treat sickness caused by malevolent spirits.\n* The Shaman can employ trance inducing techniques to incite visionary ecstasy and go on vision quests.\n* The Shaman's spirit can leave the body to enter the supernatural world to search for answers.\n* The Shaman evokes animal images as spirit guides, omens, and message-bearers.\n* The Shaman can perform other varied forms of divination, scry, throw bones/runes, and sometimes foretell of future events.\n\n---\n\n* /r/AcademicReligion_Myth\n* /r/AncientCulture_Acadmc\n* /r/AncientHistory\n* /r/AncientKnowledge\n* /r/AncientMigrations\n* /r/AncientWorld\n* /r/Animism\n* /r/Anthropology\n* /r/AskaHeathen  \n* /r/AstralProjection  \n* r/castaneda  \n* r/DMT  \n* r/Dreams  \n* /r/Druidism  \n* r/energy_work\n* /r/Foraging\n* /r/Heathenry\n* /r/HerbLore\n* /r/Norse\n* /r/Pagan\n* /r/Paganacht\n* /r/Paganism\n* /r/Paleoanthropology  \n* r/Psychonaut  \n* r/shroomers  \n* /r/Wicca	108559	7	3.3336908819695936	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:15:56.128418	2008-06-01 22:37:05-05	2025-03-14 01:15:56.12825-05

\N	cryptography	cryptography	From Greek κρύπτω krýpto "hidden" and the verb γράφω gráfo "to write" or λέγειν legein "to speak".\n\nCryptography is the practice of establishing a secure connection between two parties in the presence of a third party whom you don't want to be able to read your messages.\n\nCryptographers design algorithms and protocols, which do exactly this (and many other things). They also use a lot of time looking for security holes in existing protocols to make sure they can still be trusted. This is called *cryptanalysis*.\n\nIf you want a formal introduction to cryptography, you should read [An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.182.9999). The creator of the sub also approve of the Udacity course [Applied Cryptography - A Science of Secrets](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs387).\n\n---\n\nA combined karma of at least 10 is required to post or comment in this sub.\n\n---\n\nCryptocurrency talk is **only allowed** if it's to **discuss the cryptography** subparts of it.\n\n---\nWe won't do your homework for you. It is however allowed to help you understand material and or the questions. \n\n---\n\n**we won't solve your ciphers unless you provide us with an algorithm**. If anyone sends you a code or a cipher without telling you how they encrypted it, don't bother posting it on this subreddit - your post **will get deleted**.

Homework questions that fail to meet these requirements will be removed.\n\n  1. **Be Respectful**\n  \n  Shakespeare may have been a master at murdering people with words, but as the late, great Chadwick Boseman said, "We don't do that here."  Keep it civil, please.\n\n  1. **There Is No Authorship Question**\n\n  There are a number of other subs that discuss the various theories that someone other than the man from Stratford wrote the works attributed to William Shakespeare.

Don't flamebait or troll. Hate speech is not tolerated. Censor all usernames for posts featuring other players in a negative light. Calls to action against another player will not be tolerated.\n\n\n2. **Stay on Topic**\n> Every submission must be DIRECTLY related to Dead by Daylight - a reference in the title and/or mentioning Dead by Daylight in passing is not sufficient. This prohibits posts about games similar to Dead by Daylight, general gaming surveys, and generic reaction images.\n\n3. **Respect The Game's Integrity**\n> Don't share content featuring hackers/cheaters. Don't encourage or enable breaking the EULA. This includes advertising hacks and cheats, as well as sharing resources for how to hack or cheat (websites, guides, content creators).\n\n4. **Don't Spam**\n> Spam posts are zero-effort posts that are either automatically removed or flagged as spam. This includes empty self-posts, reposts of any kind, flooding the subreddit with a large volume of content, unapproved advertising, and excessive self-promotion.  Do not use external links to monetized sites (YouTube, Twitch, Twitter/X, TikTok, etc) — instead, upload your content natively or through non-monetized platforms like Streamable or others\n\n5. **Avoid Inappropriate Submissions** \n> These are submissions that are not suitable for /r/deadbydaylight. This includes leaks of any kind, pornography , ban appeals, trading, NSFL submissions, text-heavy non-English submissions, publicly disputing mod actions, etc.\n\n6. **Avoid Over-Saturated Submissions**\n> Oversaturated content are submissions that we define as overly common or low-effort, and thus not permitted. ranting, media posts highlighting multiple disconnected players/common bugs, common media reposts, etc.\n\n7. **Avoid Low-Effort Content**\n>The following are prohibited: Submissions which focus on any of the following: salty messages, multiple disconnected players, meme number combinations, steam/console messages, social media comments, matchmaking complaints, etc; Piggybacking off of simple questions & popular threads; AI generated content.\n\n8. **Share Art Honorably**\n> Fan content must be submitted as a direct link to the source and the artist must be credited in the submission title, regardless of watermarks, signatures, or any other identifying marks. Unsourced or inproperly fan content will be removed. Use Reddit's OC tag when submitting your own fan content.\n\n9. **Follow Reddit's Rules**\n> As a community on Reddit, we adhere to the [sidewide content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), [Redditquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) and the [User Agreement.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies)\n\n### [Full & Detailed List of Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules)\n\n##Known Bugs:\n\n**Submissions showing any of these bugs after they were added to this list, will be subject to removal.**\n\n\n**Current Bugs/Issues:**\n\n**[Bug Reports & Tech Support: Update 8.5.2 | Bugfix Patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1inwc2f/bug_reports_tech_support_update_852_bugfix_patch//)**\n\nNotice for old reddit users.

\N	shap_e	shap_e	# SETTING UP SHAP-E\n\nThe easiest way to try out Shap-E is through [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/Shap-E). Huggingface is a very simple web UI. Just type your prompt and click generate. The downside to huggingface is that you cannot download the models. You also cannot generate multiple models in one batch.\n\nAnother easy way to access this code is through the [Shap-E Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XvXBALiOwAT5-OaAD7AygqBXFqTijrVf?usp=sharing&authuser=3#scrollTo=Ye90kA6KeYjB). Colab is a virtual Python environment, which means that the code runs on a server instead of your machine. The advantage of this is that you can just click "Run" with little to no setup. **It will also run on a phone.** Just scroll to the line that says prompt = "a sword" and change a sword to whatever you want. When you're done, you can even download your models through the file interface.\n\nFinally, here is the [Official Shap-E Github Repository](https://github.com/openai/shap-e). As Shap-E is a completely open source project, you can find everything that goes into the project here.\n\n***DOWNLOADING MODELS***\n\nThe easiest way to create models you can download and use is through the Google Colab option. The final section of code in that project writes each mesh generated into a .ply file (plot cloud). \n\nTo download these plot cloud files from the virtual machine, first open the Colab File interface by clicking 'files'\nhttps://prnt.sc/W0U1w_IcThJL\n\nOnce you've done that, open the folder named shap-e by clicking the dropdown arrow next to it.\nhttps://prnt.sc/9rCOR2ikxqHz\n\nThe inside of that folder should look like this. Your models are named as example_mesh followed by a number by default. They are the highlighted files in the following screenshot\nhttps://prnt.sc/2jDoTnq_H4Ap\n\nOnce you have downloaded the files, you are ready to begin manipulating them in other software\n\n# BRINGING MODELS TO BLENDER\n\nI will be explaining Blender as it is my free 3D Modelling software of choice. Before we can import models to Blender, we have to ensure the Plot Cloud add-on is installed. This short video explains that quickly. Once you've done that, you can simply File > Import > .ply > and select your file\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y2UzSKBgSo\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you bring your model into Blender is that it has no colors. While the Shap-E model had a colorful texture, your model in Blender is completely gray. To fix this, find the dropdown in the top left corner that says "Object Mode" and change it to Vertex Paint.\nhttps://prnt.sc/nVybFfMpctXO\nhttps://prnt.sc/VLxN8f4rSyHF\n\nFrom there, you can do whatever you like with your model. You can even use Blender's painting features to edit the material on your model.\n\nAnd, speaking of editing your model, you can do that too! To edit the polygons of your model, just change to Edit Mode. You can reposition and resize points, lines, faces, or entire polygons with simple mouse movements. You can also change to Sculpt Mode to edit the shape of each polygon.\n\n#  BRINGING MODELS TO A GAME ENGINE\n\nIf you've tried to bring your models into your favorite game engine, you were probably disappointed to discover that softwares like Unity and Unreal do not support the plot cloud format natively. This is why it's important to bring our models into blender: so that we can export them in .fbx format.\n\nYou can pretty much just Import to Blender > Export as fbx. Although, it's always good to touch up your models with Blender's editing tools.\n\nOnce you bring them into your game engine, you will likely find that the model looks messed up. This is because Blender FBX exports include a camera and a light source as children of your object. You can easily delete those components to fix this.\n\nYou may also find your model has no colors. (At least, that was my experience in Unity). The reason for this is that most game engines use a default shader that does not load vertex colors to save resources. I will walk through how to fix this in Unity (because at the time of writing I have no experience in unreal :D). \n\nTo fix the problem, you need to great a Shader Graph. Although you've probably never had to do this before, it's actually really easy. Just make sure that you're using a Unity version later than 2021.2 if you want to use the built-in render pipeline.\n\nThe first step is to grab the official Shader Graph package from Unity in the package manager. Go to Window > Package Manager and install Shadergraph.\n\nNow head over to the Project panel (it's the one that has your Assets folder). Click Create and find the Shader Graph option. When you hover it, there will be a list of options. The top option should be the renderer that you are currently using. So for me, it's BuiltIn. You want to do Shader Graph > BuiltIn and click Lit Shader Graph. \n\nAlmost done! Click on your new shader graph and look into the Inspector panel. Click on "Open Shader Editor". Right Click on the background area of the Shader Editor and click Create Node. Now click the search bar that comes up and type "Vertex Color". Double click the Vertex Color option. The node that is created should have one output named Out(4). Click and drag that dot to the one that says "Base Color" underneath Fragment. Then in the top left corner, click "Save Asset".\n\nFinally, back in your project, you need to create a new material. Click your new material and look in the inspector. At the very top, click the drop down next to Shader. Click the "Shader Graphs" option, and then click your shader graph.\n\nNow all you need to do is apply this material to any models you import to Unity.	15	3	0.6329149248483293	\N	\N	0.60379748954909	2025-03-14 01:18:38.051941	2023-06-21 07:16:15-05	2025-03-14 01:18:38.051823-05

Keep it PG-13**\n\nThis is just a game about making shapes, after all. (See https://www.marshallcinema.com/mpaa#:~:text=PG%2D13Parents%20Strongly%20Cautioned,not%20be%20suited%20for%20them for exact guidelines; just replace motion picture with whatever it is being directed to.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3.

Only make a new post if you can meaningfully add to the previous post, or if yours is distinctly different.\n\nA repost will be removed if the original post is less than a week old. Posts about something that you created are exempt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**6. Content that shows how to create a floating layer must be marked as a spoiler**\n\nAn example would be the small square in the level 20 logo shape or the upper part of the level 26 compass shape. Images simply showing a shape itself or transportation of a shape, along with images taken in map mode, are exempt from this rule.\n\nThis is a less serious rule, so instead of an immediate post takedown, you will be given a 30 day warning. If you violate this rule again before the warning expires, the new post will be taken down and the warning will be refreshed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**7.

No memes \n> This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. "banana for scale," "potato quality").\n\n----- \n\n> ### 2. No related posts\n> Posts that acknowledge, "one-up," or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. "I see your X and raise you Y")\n\n-----\n\n> ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n> Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post.

If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n> **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n> **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n> ###5. No screenshots\n\n> No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab.

Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n> ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

\N	oddlysatisfying	oddlysatisfying	###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!\nHere you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does "Oddly Satisfying" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a "true definition". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* "oddly satisfying" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers.

\N	nostupidquestions	NoStupidQuestions	###There is no such thing as a Stupid Question!\n\nDon't be embarrassed of your curiosity; everyone has questions that they may feel uncomfortable asking certain people, so this place gives you a nice area not to be judged about asking it. Everyone here is willing to help. All questions are welcome such as to how to change oil, to how to tie shoes. All questions are welcome - except clear trolls, please don't be that guy. Thanks for reading all of this, even if you didn't read all of this, and your eye started somewhere else have a cookie.\n\n---\n\n**Related subreddits:**\n\n- /r/findareddit \n\n- /r/NewToReddit \n\n- /r/DoesAnybodyElse \n\n- /r/WDP (Why do people...)\n\n- /r/OutOfTheLoop (check their rules before posting)\n\n- /r/explainlikeimfive (check their rules before posting)\n\n- /r/TooAfraidToAsk\n\n- /r/myfriendwantstoknow \n\n- /r/morbidquestions\n\n- /r/tipofmytongue \n\n- /r/whatissnoodoing\n\n- /r/ExplainBothSides \n\n- /r/ChangeMyView\n\n- /r/PeopleWhoWorkAt\n\n- /r/SampleSize\n\n- /r/PollQuestions\n\n---\n\nThis subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.\n\n#RULES:\n\n# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine human-written attempt at an answer.\n\nAll direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed. (Link only responses are permitted if they are asking for a subreddit.)\n\nDo not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should "google it." Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself.\n\n#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question\n\nTry to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).\n\n#Rule 3: Be Nice\n\nFollow Reddiquette:  Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.\n\n#Rule 4: No medical advice questions\n\nNo medical advice questions\n\nA rule of thumb would be: Could this question or its answers make someone decide not to go see a doctor when they really should?\n\nIf you are asking here to avoid bothering a doctor, you probably should bother a doctor.\n\n#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions\n\nDisallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. \n\n#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions\n\nSuicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.\n\n#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging\n\nNo trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. \n\nAsking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. \n\nNo questions trying to elicit participation without learning anything of substance from the answers.\n\n#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter\n\nNothing like "Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.\n\nTasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics\n\nQuestions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.\n\nWe are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large. We reserve the right to make judgement calls on when a particular thread becomes disruptive to the sub, and we are unable to maintain a civil space for the discussion.	5571475	2538	100	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:18:28.123208	2013-02-02 02:52:24-06	2025-03-14 01:18:28.123066-05

\N	nails	Nails	***\n**Welcome to /r/nails! For anything and everything to do with nails and nail care!**\n***\nNail Care Series (In Progress):\n\n* [Intro To Basic Nail Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nails/comments/3g3832/introduction_to_basic_nail_tools_for_beginners/)\n\n____\n\n## Rule 1: Be civil and respectful.\n\n> There is a zero-tolerance policy on anything that can be perceived as bullying, harassment, ridiculing, trolling, or any actions that target an individual in a negative way. This is a place of appreciation for others artwork, so please keep that in mind at all times. \n\n## Rule 2: No NSFW content.\n\n> Keep images, comments and links work/age appropriate. Anything explicit, graphic, or sexual will be removed. Any photos that depict dangerous, risky or illicit activity is also against the rules (for example: drug use, self harm, using a cellphone while driving, etc).\n\n## Rule 3: Flair your posts! \n\n> Flairs serve as a way to let users know what your post is about. We do not remove posts that aren’t flared, but the flairs are what our search function relies upon, so we ask that you please assign them to your posts.  \n\n## Rule 4: Credit the work of others. \n\n>   If the picture or content you are posting is NOT your own, you are required to credit the artist or acknowledge that it’s not yours, either within the post’s title or in a comment. You will receive a warning before being banned, if we suspect you are stealing others art. PLEASE REPORT MISCONDUCT.\n\n## Rule 5: Stay on topic. \n\n> All posts must be related to nails (the kind that grow on your hands and feet)! Comments should contribute to the conversation and not derail the discussion.\n\n## Rule 6: No advertising.\n\n> Self-promotional content (this includes but is not limited to Youtube “trend” & “tutorial” videos, surveys, well as blog posts) are not permitted to be posted without mod approval.  If you do not follow Reddit's rules for [self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and [spam](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499), your post will be removed and you will likely be banned. Your account history will be taken into consideration when concluding if you are a spammer or not. Moderators will use their own discretion to decide. Keep the following quote in mind: ***”It’s ok to be a Reddit account with a website, but it’s not ok to be a website with a Reddit account”***\n\n## Rule 7: No trolling and/or spamming. \n\n> Report anything that you feel violates the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n## Rule 8: No distributing personal information.\n\n> This includes name, address, phone number, gender, age, location or links to websites that provide that information like Facebook. Applies to sharing the private information of people aside from yourself as well. **Small watermarks are OKAY, however we ask that you do NOT include them in your post titles.  In an effort to limit self-promotional content, we are asking users to avoid sharing Instagram/social media handles as post titles. Instead, our users now have the option to customize their [User Flair](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/article_attachments/360008300952/Screen_Shot_2018-07-30_at_2.54.33_AM.png).** On r/Nails, you can select and edit your own flair. To do so, log in using the desktop version of Reddit.com, look for where it says “Edit Flair” in the sidebar to the right. This button should be located just under our subscriber count.

Click 'Save' to finish.\n\n## Rule 9: No hate speech or suggestive comment making.\n\n> This includes but is not limited to racism, sexism and/or homophobia. And because this apparently still isn't clear enough, insulting and personally attacking other users or making unwanted sexual comments is grounds for an immediate ban. \n\n## Rule 10: No politics.\n\n> No political posts, political keywords, or political debates.\n\n\n___\n\n#**Related Subreddits:**\n\n###**Nails**\n* /r/RedditLaqueristas \n* /r/NailArt \n* /r/SoakOff \n* /r/MalePolish \n* /r/RandomActsOfPolish\n\n\n###**Professionals**\n* /r/Cosmetology \n* /r/LicensedForBeauty\n\n\n###**Other/Beauty**\n* /r/MakeupAddiction\n* /r/MakeupRehab\n* /r/Beauty\n* /r/SkincareAddiction\n* /r/AsianBeauty\n* /r/HaircareScience\n* /r/FancyFollicles\n* /r/Hair\n\n___	3836958	122	100	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:17:24.264715	2008-05-03 05:22:52-05	2025-03-14 01:17:24.264562-05

\N	redditlaqueristas	RedditLaqueristas	#Welcome to r/RedditLaqueristas!\n\n\n### Join us\nCome chat with us on [Discord!](https://discord.gg/redditlaqueristas)\n---\n\n### RULES\n\n### 1. Be nice.\n\nBe kind with constructive criticism; don't comment anything that is needlessly rude or hurtful. Our community is built around supporting and appreciating nail art, no matter the artist's current skill level.\n\nCritiques or comments including harassment, slurs, and -isms are not allowed. Engaging in the same type of behavior in retaliation is also not acceptable. Report inflammatory comments.\n\n### 2. Content must relate to nails.\n\nThis subreddit is about nails: your nails, others' nails, nail art, nail care, nail issues, nail progress, nail product reviews, tutorials, etc. **Not nail related posts are not allowed.**\n\n### 3. Credit the source of your content.\n\nIf a pic you post isn't your own, you must use the ~Inspo~ post tag AND either credit the original artist or specify you don't know who the original artist is. Please cite the source of your reference and credit the original artists, including a link to the original source if possible.\n\nCross-posting from other subreddits is allowed as long as the content follows these rules - rule #4 applies here and a list of polishes and products must be included in the cross post (please do not direct us to the main post). \n\n### 4. List polishes and products used.\n\nInclude a list of polishes and products used with your post. **Posts without lists will be removed after 12 hours.** Include the products in the post title, text body, or a separate comment after posting. Brand names *and* shade names/numbers are required.\n\nProduct list should detail each of the main items used; for example, if you used a collection of polishes, each polish should be named. Base and top coat is not necessary to list, but helpful. Number of coats is also helpful, as is spelling out the name of the brand rather than using an acronym.\n\n* In the title -> **Polish Brand - Polish Name**\n\n* In the description or as a comment below your post -> **“This is Polish Brand ‘Polish Name’ in two coats.”**\n\nIf you are a professional nail technician posting your own work, a product list is still required.\n\nIf your nails were done by someone else or at a salon, describe what you had done best to your ability and tag the post as “Salon Work.”\n\n### 5. ADs must be clearly tagged [FTC].\n\nSponsored posts* and ADs must be clearly tagged using the appropriate subreddit **POST FLAIR** (listed below) and your relationship with the brand must be explained (**USER FLAIR**). This is required by the FTC (see: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers).\n\n*Subreddits, including their mods and users, are required to abide by the rules of Reddit TOS, and Reddit communities fall under American Consumer Protection rules; as such, this is the law. Mods will intervene for posts that fail to make their relationship or sponsor with a brand clear to the community. Mods will add the AD tag to posts that appear to fall under these guidelines, and will remove posts that fail to update their posts for clarity.*\n\n*Sponsored Posts are considered **advertisements** (ADs) - sponsored means paid or compensated to post. Any content featuring an item that was given in turn or with compensation is considered an AD. In the nail polish world, the “PR” tag is often used to denote sponsored content - “PR” stands for “public relations” or “press release”, thus the item or content becomes a “PR product.” The FTC guidelines say to be specific and avoid jargon, so we are adding “AD” to all sponsored flairs and any post that falls into the following categories for clarity.\n\n**POST FLAIR:** We require flair on all user posts’ and sponsored posts must be tagged appropriately using the flair options listed below.\nPosters should also clarify sponsorship details in text when posting, such as whether the product was given freely, a prototype gift, paid content, and so forth. \n\n*    MAKER PR (AD) - When you are the brand sharing about your product and gain monetary benefits from exposure. This includes nail polish brand owners, nail technicians selling sets, small businesses, Etsy shop owners, etc.\n*    PAID PR (AD) - When a brand pays you to post ("paid PR product"). \n\n    USE THE REDDIT BRAND AFFILIATE TOGGLE WHEN POSTING\n    Need help? https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/23972085214484-What-s-a-brand-affiliate-tag\n\n*    GIFTED PR (AD) - When a brand gives a person an item ("gifted PR product") and that item is used and reviewed and shared publicly.\n*   SELF-PROMO (AD) - You are an influencer, such as a nail technician, sharing your work, but you do not gain direct monetary benefits from exposure.\n\n**USER FLAIR:** Blogger, Swatcher, and Brand Owner user flair tags are available to make your brand relationship very clear. You can change your user flair on the subreddit sidebar, by your username.\n\nNote: **Affiliate links are *not allowed*.** Posts for deals/discounts/and sales on behalf of a brand or as a brand must also be tagged as AD. By nature, these are advertisements and must be tagged as such.\n\n### 6. No explicit/pedi posts, this is a SFW subreddit.\n\nAppreciate nails/nail art WITHOUT mentioning explicit, graphic, or sexual terms. Referring to things as hot, sexy, etc. is not allowed. Please report any explicit or harassing behavior that you see in this subreddit.\n\n-\n\nPedi posts are allowed on DISCORD ONLY; POSTS HERE WILL BE REMOVED AND REDIRECTED. http://discord.gg/redditlaqueristas\n\n    Pedis are level-locked on our Discord; users must participate in order to “gain XP” (karma) before they can post pedi pics. There is too much of a communal risk to allow pedi pics openly on our subreddit.\n\n-\n\nUse cannabis and paint your nails? Come on over to our companion subreddit, /r/laquerENTstas\n\n### 7. No injury posts; no medical advice.\n\nNo injury posting. Bare and broken nails (both together) must be spoilered; nails with an injury in general should be spoilered if very mild or otherwise not posted. Just bare nails do not need to be spoilered, though some members of the community request/suggest that you do.\n\nNo seeking or giving medical advice. We recognize that nail care can be difficult at times and intimidating for new hobbyists; however, we are collectively strangers and not medical professionals, and cannot assess/diagnose/assist with hand or nail related injuries and concerns.\n\n**The following are examples of posts we cannot allow:**\n\n*    I am new to gel polish and have heard about “HEMA”...or concerns about gel…\n*    Does this look like (allergy/fungus/whatever other medical issue)?\n*    I have a gel allergy, can I use (anything that isn't regular polish)?\n*    As a comment or response: “This looks like (contact dermatitis/eczema/psoriasis/whatever).”\n\nWe cannot field these questions, we can only ever direct you to consult a medical professional or see a doctor.\n\n### 8. No BST posts.\n\nPlease take buy/sell/trade/ISO (BST) to our companion subreddit, r/RedditLaqueristaSwap.\n\n### 9. No soliciting users.\n\nNo tolerance policy for people who DM or message our users soliciting them inappropriately. Report inappropriate or uncomfortable comments or DMs and we will act accordingly (ban).\n\nUser caution: Anything that gets posted to this subreddit is available for anyone on the internet to view. It is not necessary to be a subscriber or have a Reddit account to view images posted here. If you receive a DM via your post in our sub, please read [this moderator announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/1dl0cnc/rredditlaqueristas_moderator_announcement/) before you engage in any way.\n\n### 10. No AI.\nUnless you're asking in the post title if a pic is AI generated, no AI pics are allowed..	934487	77	92.14722225184775	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:17:33.56465	2011-03-25 08:31:48-05	2025-03-14 01:17:33.564519-05
\N	destiny2	destiny2	Welcome to [**/r/Destiny2**](/r/destiny2)\n\n----\n\n# [Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/about/rules/)\n\n 1.  **SPAM/LOW EFFORT CONTENT** Frequently (re)posted questions/content that serve to karma farm, mislead, troll or inspire rage inducing threads, are Spam.

Low Effort is any/all content that contains no creativity or thought.\n 2. **ABSOLUTELY NO WITCH-HUNTING:** No Personal Attacks. Information directly or indirectly leading users to the person(s) you have shown in a negative light will result in an Immediate temporary ban. Humorous names or fun natured screenshots or posts are always welcomed. If you suspect cheating, even with evidence, should be directed to Bungie Official channels. This is not, nor will it ever be, the place to do so.\n 3. **LFG/RECRUITMENT** No Looking For Guardians posts. Check r/RaidSherpa, r/CrucibleGuidebook, or the LFG in-app avenues for assistance. All LFG posts will be removed and frequent posts will result in a temporary ban. \n 4. **NSFW CONTENT/VULGARITY:** Explicit Content, Slurs, or Offensive material is forbidden. Strive for PG-13 rating and use common sense when determining if content, to include comments, falls here. If you believe yours might but are unsure, message the mod team for assistance.\n 5. **SELF-PROMOTION, ADVERTISEMENTS, OR GIVEAWAYS:** Moderator approval must be given for posts containing or pertaining to Self Promotion or Giveaways.

Posts regarding any device or service used to manipulate the game outside of the aforementioned guidelines will result in your permanent removal from r/Destiny2. \n 7. **RELEVANT TO DESTINY 2:** r/Destiny2 is a subreddit dedicated to Destiny 2. Content will reflect that or it will be removed. \n 8. **SIMPLE LOOT/ACHIEVEMENT/GEAR ROLL POSTS:** Screenshots, directly captured or not, that are a weapon roll, armor roll, or achievement are spam. See Rule 1. Comparing rolls, or perks is boring and uninspired. You will be referred to Destiny Item Manager (DIM), Destiny Recipes, or Destiny Massive Breakdowns spreadsheet. r/Destiny2 is not for those posts. \n 9. **UNORIGINAL/NON-UNIQUE VIDEOS OR CLIPS:** Unoriginal/Achievement videos or clips are not for this subreddit.

\N	coins	coins	#***Coin Collecting - Coin News - Coins in History***\r\n\r\nWe welcome longtime collectors, as well as brand new ones and non-collectors. Please read our pinned How-To Guide for important info on using r/coins. Thank you!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#R/COINS RESOURCES\r\n##[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq)\r\n##[Frequent Coins List (FCL)](https://r-coins.com/fcl/)\r\n##[What's Up With My Coin? List (WUWMC)](https://r-coins.com/wuwmc/)\r\n##[Lincoln LG/SM Date Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/guides/lincoln-date-varieties/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n  |  |  \r\n:--|:--|:-:  \r\n**Rule 1** - ***Don't put coins up your nose***|The main purpose of this sub is to provide a place to learn about, discuss, and show off your favorite coins from around the world. Your participation here requires that you be respectful of the hobby and your fellow collectors. Posts and comments which are made with the sole intention of disrespecting coins or collectors will be removed. This includes "coin gore" - pictures of severely damaged coins with no particular numismatic interest.\r\n**Rule 2** - ***Being civil to other people is not only appreciated here, it's a requirement***|Behavior that is unkind and unhelpful is not allowed here. Don't make fun of new collectors. Do not bicker. Don’t threaten. Don't name-call. Don’t shame. Don’t harass. Don’t be a jerk. Don’t create or respond to drama. Don’t troll others or let yourself be trolled. Don’t engage in uncivil exchanges. You do not "have the right to defend yourself" verbally here. Know when to disengage. Violation of this rule will get your post or comment removed, and repeated offenses will result in probation.\r\n**Rule 3** - ***No spam***|NO SPAM. This also means not flooding r/coins with many posts in a short amount of time, even if they are non-commercial in nature. Please don't exceed 2 posts in a 24-hour period, or a total of 3 posts in 48 hours. Reposts will be removed without comment unless cleared with mods in advance. If you have a large collection to post, please create an imgur album and post the link.\r\n**Rule 4** - ***No posts about paper money, or crypto/digital currency***|Posting pictures of or asking about paper money? Please go to r/papermoney, r/uspapermoney, r/BankStrapHunting or r/banknotes and give them the additional traffic. If your post contains photos of both coins and paper money it will very likely be removed.  Also, please don't make posts here about digital / crypto / blockchain currency or related products. They aren't real coins according to our definition and this isn't the place for them. Any such posts made here will be removed as spam.\r\n**Rule 5** - ***No self-promotion or commercial activity allowed, no links to your blogs, websites, or social media***|NO self-promotion. Do NOT post links or references to your social media accounts, YouTube channels, websites, etc. NO offers to buy, sell or trade coins in discussion threads, use PM/DM instead. NO direct links to individual items actively for sale on eBay or other sales sites. Search results or already sold items are okay. If you wish to buy, sell or trade your coins please consider posting to r/PMsForSale, r/CoinSales, r/CoinBay, or r/CoinSwap.\r\n**Rule 6** - ***No politics or religion, especially divisive comments that lead to heated arguments and incivility***|Politics and religion - especially partisan politics - can sometimes have a bearing on the world of coins. However, in the interest of avoiding heated off-topic arguments, we ask that you avoid those subjects on this subreddit. This also isn't the place to discuss your religious beliefs or opinions, or those of others. Let's try to keep things calm and civil here please.\r\n**Rule 7** - ***Memes, Humor, and Trash posts***|Memes can be posted on the first Monday of the month and must not break any of the other rules. Trash posts are satirical, trollish, poor quality, meant to derail discussions or cause the biggest reaction with the least effort. These posts may be removed without notice. Humor isn't forbidden, but all posts must reflect the legitimate purpose of this sub, and be in the pursuit of the goals of our hobby. Any reference "tree-fiddy" will be removed - this joke needs to die.\r\n**Rule 8** - ***Keep it clean***|Vulgarity, obscenity, violence, sexual innuendo, and other potentially offensive content in posts or comments is subject to immediate removal without notice. This sub WILL remain a safe place for everyone - including children. Legitimate coin images or related posts depicting or referencing NSFW themes MUST be flaired "NSFW". Coins depicting nudity, violence, or racism (including Nazi coins) which have a numismatic significance ARE ALLOWED on this sub – but you must use the NSFW flair!\r\n**Rule 9** - ***Do your own research before posting***|Low-effort posts will be removed. Your question may be removed for failing to do minimal research, failing to read the pinned comment, FAQ, "Frequent Coin List", or "What's up with my coin?". Please don't consider this criticism or punishment - it is our intent to keep the feed free of questions which can be easily answered by the author prior to posting. If you aren't sure whether you should post, please reach out to the mod team for guidance.\r\n**Rule 10** - ***Post Original Content***|Posts with pictures should be original content. Screenshots should be cropped/edited to only include the necessary portions of the picture (e.g. removing phone screen controls, excluding names/companies/PII/etc.) Anything which may be promoting a sale or company will be removed. Screenshots of outrageously priced coins or from dubious websites will be removed. Posts with unrelated "for attention" pictures will be removed.\r\n**Rule 11** - ***No reposts***|Exact posts which have already been made in the past will be removed. Your previous post not getting an answer or attention is not a valid reason to re-post - however you may attempt to make a better post (clearer pictures, etc.) If you are re-posting to fix a rule violation in a previously removed post, please contact the mods first for approval to repost. If you repost (without approval from the mods) simply because your previous post was removed, your will receive a 3-day ban.	253222	303	100	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:18:07.857748	2008-04-22 13:36:20-05	2025-03-14 01:18:07.857637-05

\N	tightlacing	Tightlacing	This community is for tightlacers, seasoned and beginners alike. Tightlacing does not necessarily have a defined definition. Some consider tightlacing to be wearing your corset at high reductions, some consider tightlacing to be occasional, and others consider it to be a lifestyle choice in which one wears their corset regularly. This community accepts all of these definitions equally, so long as the garment you are wearing is true corset. We do not condone fajas or any other stretchy garments masquerading as corsets.\n\nTo help you, we have compiled some resources. The [Blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tightlacing/comments/du7gdn/blacklisted_brands/),  the [Recoomended brands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tightlacing/comments/du8wyf/brands_to_consider/), as well as r/waisttraining's [Waist Training For Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/waisttraining/comments/ie4h2h/waist_training_beginners_information/) which contains a plethora of useful information, and not just for beginners!\n\nRules:\n\n1. This is an inclusive community.  We are inclusive of all genders, identities, and body types, period. This is non-negotiable. Body/identity snark will be tolerated. \n\n2. This community is for the use of corsets only, we do not condone the use of fajas or stretchy shapewear falsely labeled as corsets. Any posts relating to these garments will be removed. \n\n3. Please do your best to avoid perpetuating misinformation. We realize that there is little evidence for much of what is accepted to be true of corsetry, however, we will not tolerate any behaviors pushing misinformation or negative stereotypes. Do your best to provide reliable information and sourcing. If you are unsure, simply add a disclaimer to your statement or ask for assistance. \n\n4. Abusive behaviors will not be tolerated. This includes snark as detailed in rule 1, as well as other forms of aggression. Please help us to keep the community positive and supportive.\n\n5. Please direct all NSFW posts to r/corsetsnsfw and r/corsetsgonewild. This is a community for the tightlacing lifestyle. Porn, nudes, and other cheeky content is better suited in other communities. This allows our users to better control their content exposure. We understand that there may be some relevant content which may need to be tagged NSFW due to the nature of corsetry, and this is entirely permissible. \n\nRules are subject to change. Changes will be made in the sidebar/community info. Thank you in advance for your understanding and compliance.	10139	1	0.7398965583506062	\N	\N	0.5037491621963089	2025-03-14 01:18:53.652705	2013-10-19 15:48:15-05	2025-03-14 01:18:53.652406-05

\N	pregnant	pregnant	**Welcome to /r/Pregnant.** \n\n**If you or someone you know may be pregnant, please click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1kj3rb/so_you_might_be_pregnant_read_this_first/). Pregnancy scare posts will be removed.**\n\n\n\n**The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.**\n\n\n\nThis space is for all pregnant people from all walks of life. Whether you're trying to conceive or currently in labor, whether you're a surrogate or a birth parent, whether you're keeping your baby or choosing abortion or are undecided, we are here to be a safe and supportive resource for you.\n\nPlease note these important subreddit rules: \n\n1.  **Respect pregnant people's choices without judgement.** Nobody is too young, too poor, too single, too manly, too gay, too *whatever* to be pregnant. No pregnant person needs you to tell them that they're eating wrong, drinking wrong, weighing wrong, exercising wrong, or doing wrong by their pregnancy. \n\n2.  **This space is pro-choice.** No links to anti-choice material or websites allowed, no anti-choice comments allowed.\n\n3. **No body policing.** Please take your weight loss/gain comments and links elsewhere. \n\n4. **Bigotry will not be tolerated.** Please hit the report button if you see any racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, transphobic, etc. comments to help mods remove them promptly. We are a [friend of the fempire](http://redd.it/r6h1s).\n\n5. **Please do not promote or link to other pregnancy subreddits here.** Some relevant subreddits are listed below with necessary warnings, but in our experience some other subreddits have very little moderation, which means lots of bigotry and hostility towards pregnant people. This is a safe space. Links to such subreddits do not belong here. \n\n6. **Asking if you or someone you know could be pregnant will result in a ban.** Nobody on the internet can tell you if someone is pregnant. Take a test.\n\n7. **Questions regarding medical issues must be submitted to the sticky post.** Starting Oct 23, 2017, all medical questions must be submitted to the stickied post. Any questions posted individually will be removed and redirected.\n\n\n**RELATED SUBREDDITS**\n\n\n\n- /r/miscarriage - a safe and supportive space for those who have experienced miscarriage\n\n- /r/plusSizedPregnancy - a safe and supportive private subreddit for the pregnant and plus sized.

If you have another question, you may have some luck searching the subreddit for related questions / topics. \n\n---\n---\n**Guidelines:** Detailed Guidelines in our Wiki [here!](http://goo.gl/cxxQRd)\n\n**1. Constructive criticism & respect**\n\n* Constructive criticism or disagreement is fine – judgmental and mean comments are not. Comments must be constructive and contribute to conversation. Name calling, abusive comments, idea bashing, budget-shaming, or arguing with other posters will not be tolerated. In this vein, we do not allow AITA / AITB posts here. Weddit is also gender & relationship diverse, so please keep that in mind when addressing posts!\n\n**2. Context**\n\n* All posts must be directly related to your own wedding or your own personal experiences with weddings and planning. We encourage you to share location for any discussion of budget, etiquette, timeline, or other region-influenced topic for this international subreddit. We do not allow anniversary posts for inactive Wedditors, guest attire posts, or any allow medical advice posts or comments, including weight change and COVID19 decisions. We do not allow sharing your current / goal size or weight.\n\n**3. Text Only Tuesdays**\n\n* Only text posts are allowed from 12 AM to 11:59 PM EDT on Tuesdays. All image/video only posts or posts that require images will be removed. Please feel free to post your pictures and videos - including engagement ring photos- any other day of the week! (Please note videos must be hosted on v.Reddit or Streamable). \n\n**4. No memes/funny gif posts:** \n\n* /r/trollxweddings is a better place for these.\n\n**5. No bashing posts** \n\n* We do not allow bashing posts such as "what's a tradition you hate?" or "what decor is overrated?” or "what are your unpopular wedding opinions". Weddit is made up a diverse group of people with diverse traditions. Treating the typical wedding in your area as THE right version of weddings is not cool. We should treat other weddings the way we want ours treated.\n\n**6. No 'tacky'**\n\n* We generally don't allow the use of the word tacky here, including asking 'is this tacky'. 'Tacky' is subjective, not descriptive, and too often weaponized. Situations vary greatly, and there is no one sole arbiter of etiquette. We also don't allow debates on the etiquette of cash bars.\n\n**7. No Advertising, Market Research, or GoFundMe Links**\n\n* No monetizing the subreddit. This includes but is not limited to: advertising, self-promoting, sharing your work, affiliate links, blogs/vlogs, market research / feedback solicitation, free giveaways. Coupons/discounts can be shared in the Daily Discussion Chat. We do not allow GoFundMe, vote solicitations, or other similar requests. \n**Vendor AMAs:** Please contact the mods first for verification. Please note that you cannot advertise in your AMA.\n\n**8. Post multiple photos in an album, not as multiple posts**\n\n* When sharing multiple pictures in a short period of time, please post them in an album/in the same post. Repeat or similar posts that do not uniquely contribute to discussion may be removed. \n\n**9. Privacy/identifying information**\n\n* You may include your own names and faces at your discretion. Addresses  and last names of other people must be obscured, and wedding website URLs are not allowed.\n\n**10. Don't share Weddit content elsewhere**\n\n* No sharing other posts, pictures, etc from Weddit to other groups without the express permission of the original poster. Especially do not share to any shaming forums, or in order to be negative about or mock anyone.\n\n\n**11. Use that report button:** \n\n* If you feel a post is in violation of any of the rules, or is inappropriate content, please click the report button underneath the post or comment. \n\n---\n\n**The Mods.** If you need help please [send us a message.](http://goo.gl/5xlujx) **All posts from new users or users with negative karma are held for mod approval.**\n\n---\n\nHere's a list of [Helpful Wedding Websites](http://goo.gl/PQt7Il)\n\n---\n\n**FAQ Fridays!

\N	frugalfemalefashion	FrugalFemaleFashion	##What we're about:\n\n* The place for coupons, discounts, sales and all things when it comes to Frugal Female Fashion! Please see our growing Wiki for more details on fits, stores, best value and more. \n\n##What type of Posts are allowed?\n\n* Deals (markdowns, sales, price slashes, special offers, coupons, price promotions), discussions, reviews of products you purchased recently, a brand or anything else that would fall under a constructive and helpful review.\n* Swag Brag posts from thrift stores are **no longer allowed** and will result in a temporary ban.  Only post swag brag if it is from an accessible sale from a nation-wide store. \n\n## What can't I post?\n\n* Any referral code of any type except Amazon Smile, (includes "PM me for referral" posts), videos, blogs, news articles. Basically, if it's not a deal, discussion, or review don't post it. \n\n* Amazon & eBay links are on an approval basis. Automoderator will automatically remove these, but the mod team will review them and approve based on the legitimacy of the deal provided.  Items shipped and sold by Amazon or eBay goods will most likely be approved depending on their value to the subreddit. If you try and circumvent the automoderator removal by posting an additional link with a different URL you will be banned for 7 days. \n*  Shortened URL's. \nPlease post the full website link when submitting a post\n* No links to AliExpress, Romwe, Cupshe, Alie Voss, or Sheinside. \n Although you may be able to find great reps, these items ship from China and several FFF users have experienced issues such as misrepresented items or shipping errors.  As always, please use consumer caution when purchasing items from these websites.\n* We do not allow self-promotion. That means if you own the business or work for the business, your post will be removed.  Astroturfing accounts will be banned permanently. \n\n* All referral codes other than Amazon Smile must go in the [Referral Link Master Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/81fgps/referral_link_master_post/) only. \n\n##Why did my post get removed?\n\n* Chances are it broke rules of the subreddit. Automoderator removes all links from accounts that are new or have less than a combined comment/link Karma of 50 to prevent spam.

\N	lgbt	lgbt	#Want Flair?\n\nClick the (edit) button ⇧ up above!\n\n[](/safe-space)\n\n#### [](#h4-green)\n\n>This subreddit is by and for people who are Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities (GSRM), including but by no means limited to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people, and respect for our diversity and experiences is paramount. All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:\n\n-------------\n\n\n# Rules\n\n---\n\n>###1: Be respectful   \nNo GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: "[TW] Title of Post". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.\n\n---\n\n>###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive'   \nDemonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just "shouldn't be so sensitive." For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. \n\n---\n\n>###3: No bait-and-switch posts   \nBait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.\n\n---\n\n>###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders   \nr/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.\n\n---\n\n>###5: No survey and research requests   \nWe are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.\n\n---\n\n>###6: No promoting hate   \nHaving posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n>###7: Don't share hate speech    \nr/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.\n\n---\n\n>###8: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail!   \nPlease send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.\n\n---\n\n>###9: NSFW Content.   \nr/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.\n\n---\n\n>###10: Provide sources when sharing news\nWe require any post sharing news/social media reactions to news articles to include a link to the original article or announcement in the post body.\n\n---\n\n>###11: No posts asking to rate, roast, or make assumptions about you or your identity.\nThese posts encourage stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on presentation. Often these can make people uncomfortable and bring out a mix of stereotypes and pressure to present a specific way. This rule includes, but is not limiting to; asking whether or not you pass, asking people to guess your gender/sexuality, and asking people to make assumptions about you based on your appearance.\n\n---\n\n>###12: Moderator Discretion.\nUnfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.\n\n>###13: Use Content Warning flair for upsetting posts.\nIf you think community members might be upset by the content you are sharing, use the content warning flair, adding a short description. The post will be automatically marked as a spoiler, but please check our rules on NSFW content and sharing hate.\n\n\n-------------\n\n#[Important Information on Staying Safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/kytz4c/a_reminder_on_staying_safe_online_for_all_our/)\n\n---\n\n#[Report Rule Breaking Content](https://www.reddit.com/report)\n\n---\n\n#[Interested in becoming a Mod?

\N	beauty	beauty	**RULES**\n\n**1. High quality on-topic posts ONLY.**\n\nHigh-quality posts help solve specific beauty-related problems or provide beauty-related solutions. Low-quality posts clutter the subreddit and tend to be repetitive. Examples of low-quality posts: “What is my [face shape, eye shape, skintone]” questions, glow up requests, compliment fishing, non-beauty advice, sympathy farming, attention seeking, and vague-titled posts.\n\nFor more examples of low quality/off-topic posts, please visit the [/r/beauty wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/beauty/wiki/index). \n\n**2. NO SPAM.**\n\nNO spam allowed. No surveys. No links to your own blog posts or social media accounts. No YouTube videos. No promotional websites. No link codes. No porn. NO SELF PROMOTIONS! NO SPAM ACCOUNTS. (Yes, some brand accounts and porn accounts count as spam too.) No AI/ChatGPT.\n\n**3. Self posts, pictures, and videos are allowed as long as they're your own content.**\n\nSelf posts, pictures, and videos are acceptable, but should be your own content (or give credit to the source) and be useful to the community. Pictures and videos can directly be uploaded to Reddit. Links to YouTube and TikTok videos are not permitted.\n\n**4. NO PORN.**\n\nWe are not an 18+ subreddit. We're counting porn (and similar posts) as spam and instant-ban worthy. Posts or comments with porn, nudity, toplessness, privates showing, only fans promotions, and the like will be removed. Commenters/posters that violate this rule will be banned. Please report any porn-related content that you see.\n\n**5. Harassment can get you banned. Permanently.**\n\nWe enforce Reddit’s site-wide rules. Rude, offensive, judgmental, sexualized/thirsty, and generally mean comments will be removed and the user risks being banned at the mods' discretion. Please report any comments that fit this description so we can act accordingly.\n\n**6. Moderator discretion.**\n\nModerators reserve the right to make decisions in the best interests of the sub and its users. Attempting to evade the sub's rules or filters is a bannable offense.	1116971	344	83.175293857158	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:19:52.179414	2008-08-19 02:31:02-05	2025-03-14 01:19:52.179285-05

\N	trans	trans	Trans* related discussion, pictures, links, etc. A community moderated by trans people *for* trans people.\n\n---\n\nMake sure anything NSFW is marked as such. If it is NSFL, please tag your link title with [NSFL] and tag the post as NSFW. Please remember that although NSFW content is allowed, **this is not a porn sub**. If the point of your post is purely sexual in nature, it should go somewhere else.\n\nPlease also keep in mind that this subreddit is a safe space and we are not here to explain ourselves. **Attempts to debate on topics related to trans people or the trans experience such as; trans participation in sports, whether or not certain words are slurs, or the validity of trans identities WILL RESULT IN A BAN**. If you're curious about the trans experience, you would have better luck browsing /r/asktransgender.\n\nTransphobia, bigotry, and hate speech of any kind will **not** be tolerated here.\n\n---\n\nDue to the nature of this subreddit, your submission will most likely be automatically filtered and placed in the queue for manual approval. This is normal and you do not need to contact us about it, if your post or comment breaks no rules then it will be approved in time.\n\n---\n\nThis subreddit is explicitly for and by trans people. We do not accept any ideology, political stance, or religious stance that would exclude **ANY** trans people as appropriate for this subreddit and will action accordingly if we see people trying to spread those sorts of things here.

No Hate Speech - No hate speech allowed whatsoever. This is a ZERO tolerance policy. This rule includes any terminology that is used as a slur or pejorative against anyone; even if you’ve personally reclaimed the word, does not mean everyone has, and we ask that you respect that when speaking with other users.  \nIf you must use a slur to in your submission, we ask that you censor it as follows: F-slur, T-slur, S-slur, etc. Using asterisks or other symbols to censor part or all of the word is not acceptable.\n\n2. Be Respectful - Respect the people who belong here. Including:\n    - No insulting transgender people, their appearance, or purposeful misgendering.\n    - No treating being transgender as a mental illness or as being lesser in any way.\n    - No arguing with transgender people about their identity.\n    - No arguing with transgender people about their vulnerabilities, including anything related to sports, laws, etc.\n    - Anything else the Moderation Team deems disrespectful.\n\n3. Prohibited Post Types - To maintain a positive, inclusive, non-confrontational environment, we reserve the right to prohibit certain types of posts on this subreddit. This includes, but is not limited to:\n    - Videos or Podcasts\n    - Debates that challenge any facet of transgender existence\n    - Asking for any critique of your appearance\n    - Requests for name advice\n    - Requests for medical advice, including DIY HRT\n    - For a complete list of prohibited topics, please see this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/ppt/\n\n4. This Space is for Transgender People – While we appreciate that many cisgender people want to support transgender people, r/trans is a space for transgender people to discuss their lives and issues that surround them, and submissions from outside of the community are not welcome in this subreddit.  \nIf you are a cis person with a question about the trans community, or the partner of a cis person, please ask your question in r/AskTransgender.  \nIf you are the parent of a trans child, you can ask your questions in r/cisparenttranskid.\n\n5. No Pornography or Suggestive Posts – Posts that are pornographic or sexually explicit are prohibited. This includes:\n    - Nudity below the waist or "female presenting nipples" (This is Reddit's guidelines).\n    - Images of a person wearing solely underwear\n    - Images that entice through sexy or flirty posing\n    - Deliberately provocative titles (such as "Would you date me?")\n    - Erotica/"text porn"\n    - Note that we do allow NSFW text posts that discuss issues a user may be having in their life.\n\n6. No Gatekeeping Ideologies - Our subreddit is one specifically aimed at allowing people to explore their identity and creating a safe space for those identities to be explored. Truscum, transmedicalist, and other gatekeeping ideologies do not serve our subreddit's goals and comments or posts promoting such are prohibited. This specifically includes suggesting that gender affirming medical care should only be available to adults.\n\n7. No Advertisements, Surveys, Petitions, or Crowdfunding –We do not allow advertising or promotion of any kind on r/trans. This includes links to things such as OnlyFans, Instagram, Discord, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, or any sort of crowdfunding websites.  \nIf you wish to advertise a new transgender-related subreddit, please Message the Moderation Team using the link below.\n\n8. No Sharing Hate Speech/Bigtory – We do not allow sharing images, links, or crossposts containing hate speech or bigoted content. As trans people, we face enough bigotry in our daily lives, and we do not want our users exposed to such content just by scrolling through the subreddit nor to provide the originator a larger platform.  \nYou are welcome to describe what you experienced in a text post for the purposes of venting or seeking help. Please remember to flair the post as “Trigger” or “Possible Trigger” as is appropriate.\n\n9. No Posts About Self Harm or Suicide – We understand that life can be difficult, and at times life can feel overwhelming or that you have no other options, but there are always options available, we promise you that. If you are experiencing a crisis, we ask that rather than making a post here, please reach out to one of the resources listed on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines), where most country’s crisis lines are listed, as we’re unable to host posts about suicide and self-harm here.\n\n10. Address The Community Respectfully – Please keep in mind that we are a diverse community, with many different experiences, and we expect our members to respect that when making posts/comments. We ask that you remember that this is not a community specifically for any one gender, and that you don't address the community in that way. This includes things that says something like "Hey (guys/girls/dudes/women/men)" and the like.\n\n11. Adult Content Accounts – Accounts that have a history of posting adult content, participate in adult content subreddits, or have links to adult content services in their profile are not permitted to participate in this subreddit. r/trans is an all-ages space, and we have an obligation to protect our underage users from being exposed to adult content.  \nPlease see this link for further information on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/rjl6id/updated_nsfw_rules/\n\n12. Chasers are Not Welcome Here – r/trans is a safe space for trans people, their stories, discussions, and content. It is NOT a place for people to fetishize us, attempt to hit on or pick up users, or any other general creepy behavior (“Chaser” behavior). Similarly, if such behavior is seen in your account’s post/comment history, you are not permitted to participate in r/trans. The Moderation Team maintains discretion as to what is included in this rule.\n\n13. No DM Requests – Users are not allowed to ask others to DM, chat with, or contact them on another platform for ANY reason. This subreddit is for finding community, not establishing one-on-one connections or friendships.  \nThis rule does not prohibit users from looking for support groups or other such activities in their area; it is specifically prohibiting “making friends” or other other private communication requests.\n\n# [Read our Expanded Rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/expanded-rules)\n\n# [Read about our Prohibited Post Types here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/ppt)	594526	325	100	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:19:37.149491	2011-05-08 22:38:53-05	2025-03-14 01:19:37.149358-05

\N	asktransgender	asktransgender	#Welcome!\nQuestions and discussions about, for, to, or from the Reddit transgender community. \n\n*Open to anyone with a question.*\n\n---\n\n#[Rules](/r/asktransgender/wiki/rules):  \n\n#####1. Your post should be relevant, inclusive, and encourage discussion.\n\n* Titles should be in the form of a question; if this is not possible, make sure the post title or content provides a starting point for discussion. \n* Posts that *can* be applied broadly *must* be applied broadly.\n * Don't ask things specifically of a given group if the question is applicable outside that group.\n * Use inclusive language, e.g. not "How did you ladies choose a female name?" but instead "How did you find your new name?"\n* Image submissions are disabled. Do not link through to images.\n\n##### 2. Be respectful. \nNo:\n\n* bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, etc) or [gendered slurs](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs),\n* hateful speech or disrespectful commentary,\n* personal attacks,\n* [invalidation](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation), [gender policing](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing), or shaming based on stealth, open or closeted status.\n\n##### 3. No trolling or personal agendas. \nPosts and comments made with such ulterior motives are not allowed.\n\n##### 4. No stirring the pot. \n* Do not post threads that intentionally create drama or encourage witch-hunting.\n* Do not post threads about ongoing drama elsewhere (on other subreddits, on other websites, in the news, etc.) - political discussion is expected and permitted.\n* Do not target other subreddits, link to threads in other subreddits, or otherwise encourage brigading.\n\n#####5. Minors **under the age of 13** are not allowed on Reddit. \n> [Although we welcome users from all walks of life, Reddit is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy#wiki_children_under_13)\n\n##### 6.

Mark NSFW posts. \nPosts that center around genitals, breasts, sex, or content you would not discuss with coworkers, your grandmother, or other delicate company should be marked as NSFW.\n\n##### 8. No fetishization or chasers. \n\n* We will remove any posts treating trans bodies as fetishes or objects, and any posts that indicate your attraction is more important than your partner's dysphoria.\n\n* Do not ask how to meet trans people.

\N	mtf	MtF	-----\n\n##Rules (read before posting):##\n\n*(Hover over each box to expand it)*\n\nSome|Rules\n:-:|:-:|:-:\n1. Respect other users|... Even when those users show disrespect themselves. We're better than the trolls and haters, and we can show that by not rising to take the bait. Be respectful, and we'll all be happier for it.\n2. No abuse|Abuse is absolutely banned here, and is treated extremely seriously. Abusive users will be banned.\n3. Discrimination is forbidden|There is no such thing as "valid discrimination," and this sub will remove any post or comment that demonstrates racism, sexism, body shaming or any other bigotry you care to name. Equality is the watchword.\n4. Non-binary does not mean non-trans|Non-op, genderqueer, agender or any other denomination of transgender is still transgender. Treating a person like they're lesser or somehow inferior because they're non-binary is immoral, and shows a clear lack of understanding.\n5. Asking for birthnames is not cool|Asking for, or posting, a person's personal information can be dangerous, and it's also against [the site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules).\n6. Malicious reporting is abuse|Maliciously reporting someone who doesn't break our rules spams the report system, and it's against the site-wide rules. Don't do it.\n7. ABSOLUTELY NO PORN!|There are places online which cater to that *particular* fetish, but this is not one of them. Users who are here to post porn or advertise will be removed.\n8. Tag any NSFW stuff|If you got a cool tattoo or something else that's incidentally NSFW, please tag it as such.\n9. Destructive criticism is abuse|It's hard to convey inflection and intent via text. What may seem like tough love to one person may come across as hatred or abuse to another. It's not helpful, don't do it.\n10. No soliciting medical advice|We're not doctors and we can't vouch for the safety or validity of any medical information. Posts that ask for or give advice on how to obtain or use DIY hormones will be removed, as will comments that explicitly state where to get black-market drugs. These are dangerous medications, not toys.\n11. Submissions or comments from users with 0 or less karma will be removed|This is to prevent trolling. If you have less than 0 karma, you won't be allowed to submit here. This is a hard rule.\n12. No "X celebrity/politician is a transphobe" threads|We all probably already know and we don't need that kind of negativity in our **Safe Space.**\n13. If you want to promote something, message the moderators first|This sub is a **Safe Space,** not a knowledge aggregator, not a traffic generator, and certainly **not a public wallet.** There are far better places like /r/transspace to post surveys or tell people about a trans-related service or group. (You should ask the mod(s) there before posting too.)\n14. Do not disrupt the **Safe Space**|If the mods think you're being too much of an arsehole, but it's not covered by the rules, your post will be removed and you might be banned. We want to cultivate a warm, **Safe Space** environment, and anything that goes against that may be subject to removal and the submitter to disciplinary action.\n15. Please keep all selfies in the selfie thread.|Please keep all selfies in the selfie thread or post them on another subreddit that's releveant. Any selfies outside of the selfie thread will be removed. Photos of IDs and medications are also forbidden because they include personal and/or medical information.\n\n##General Guidelines:##\nGeneral|Guidelines\n:-:|:-:|:-: \nComment with respect| It's important to remember that behind every username is an individual with motivations, goals, and problems just like you. We never really know what the situation is on the other side of the keyboard, so please try to be mindful of what you say and how you treat others.\nVote with care| This is a safe place for people who need to talk about their life as a trans person. If we downvote posts and comments into the ground, we discourage free expression. Save your downvotes for trolls.\n"Will I pass" threads are discouraged| Whilst not banned, WIP threads are discouraged from being posted here. If you do post these threads, please accept that our official policy is honesty: if you do not pass, or might not pass in the future, subscribers are encouraged to tell you this (in the nicest possible way). We are not here to lie to you.\n\n***\n\n**Other subreddits you might like:**\n\n* /r/asktransgender - Self-posts and questions from trans people\n* /r/ftm - For the FAAB among us\n* /r/genderqueer - For non-binary folks\n* /r/transadorable - Adorable trans people selfies: child-friendly!\n* /r/transgender - Transgender articles and links\n* /r/transpositive - Success stories and posts\n* /r/TransSpace - A safe place for all trans-identified people\n* /r/transvoice - A voice-coaching subreddit for transgender people of all genders.

This includes when responding to to rule-breakers (if someone breaks rules, don't engage & report them to mods).\n* 2. **No bigotry.** Including but not limited to content that marginalizes, discriminates against, or demeans any group based on gender identity, ethnicity, religion, race, nationality, body size, appearance, sex, or any other characteristic.\n* 3. **No sexual feedback.** This includes any kind of harassment, sexualization, objectification, photo or message requests or unsolicited PMs.\n* 4. **No upsetting the safe space.** It's important that we keep a [Safe Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_space). Creeps are unwelcome. \n* 5. **No surgery shaming.** Do not shame reductions, augmentations, breast lifts, etc.\n* 6. **No pseudoscience.** Discussions about pseudoscience are allowed, however it is prohibited to present pseudoscientific claims as a legitimate medical advice. This includes for example homeopathy, chiropractic and acupuncture.\n* 7. **No porn or porn-adjacent accounts.** Mods reserve the right to remove posts and comments at their discretion. No porn, self-promotion, or posting pictures that are also posted to NSFW subs. Provide context to your photos to prevent being mistaken for a bot or spam account.\n* 8. **No medical advice.** Instead seek out a professional or visit other subreddits, for example: r/AskDocs, r/Medical_Advice, r/DiagnoseMe, r/SkincareAddiction, r/SkincareAddicts, r/SkinCareScience, r/DermatologyQuestions, r/Eczema, r/Psoriasis\n* 9. **No mentioning your age if you're underage.** This predominantly applies to selfies/picture posts, but we recommend you refrain from it in all submissions where it isn't relevant to the post.\n* 10. **No ban evasion.** New accounts that are identified by Reddit as being banned previously will be automatically banned, and any posts removed.\n* 11. **No message screenshots.** Creepy and rude message screenshots belong in the pinned megathread, not as their own posts. Censor usernames other than your own.\n* 12. **No selfies (except rare exceptions).** They are only allowed here in very specific situations where they are absolutely necessary to gain help. If you're unsure, message mods before posting. And if you think your selfie was removed in error, please reach out to the mods.\n* 13. **No white knighting.** We don't need your [white knighting](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/White_knighting).\n* 14. **No impersonation.** Do not impersonate anyone else via name, picture, or any other way, privately or publicly, for any reason whatsoever.\n___\n\n*[This subreddit is a body snark free zone](http://www.thelingerieaddict.com/2012/04/lingerie-addict-body-snark-free-zone.html).*\n\n##Resources##\n***[Busty Resources](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)***, a boobitor-created wiki, was inspired by the lack of consistent, reliable, and accessible information related to breasts available online.\n\n* [Find your UK Size](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Bra_sizing_by_country)\n* [Find out if your bra fits](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_tell_if_a_bra_fits)\n* [Find your breast shape](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Breast_shape)\n* [How to correctly put on a bra](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_put_on_a_bra)\n* [Bust-friendly apparel](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Apparel)\n* [Offline bra retailers](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Offline_retailer)\n* [Online bra retailers](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Online_retailer)\n\n##See also##\n\n###Private BBP Subreddit###\n\n[r/safebigboobproblems](https://www.reddit.com/r/safebigboobproblems/)\n\nPrivate means that the subreddit and all its contents aren't publicly accessible.

\N	tallgirls	TallGirls	## [TallGirls Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TallGirls/wiki/index)\n\n---\n\n##Rules\n\n\n### Who is this sub for?\n\n* It is for anyone identifying as a girl or woman who is also tall. It is not for men. It is not for short people. This rule had to be created and placed at the top of the rules because people have forgotten how to read. If you violate this rule, bans are swift & permanent. If this is not clear, try [this link.](https://irisreading.com/23-tips-to-improve-reading-comprehension-for-adults/)\n\n\n### Be Kind, Be Considerate, Don't Be A Bigot\n\n* Respect differences but find a way to reach common ground or agree to disagree without fighting. \n\n* Cruel & rude comments about body image & gender are never appropriate. \n\n* Don't gatekeep height. Don't put down the not-talls.\n\n* Take a minute to consider the spirit of a post or comment before making a hasty reply.\n\n* Hate speech against protected classes is prohibited. If you're not sure what these are - use a search engine.\n\n* Violations will result in a ban. Not all bans are eligible for appeal.\n\n### Account Age, Karma Limits, & Filters\n\n* Like many communities, we use filters for content, account age, & low karma. \n\n* This means your content may be filtered even if you are a long-time member b/c you triggered a keyword, phrase, or used an image. \n\n* It means if your account is newish, you will likely be filtered. \n\n* It means if your karma is low (or negative) you will be filtered. \n\n* Yes, this sucks, but it is not a personal slight against you as a user. Please just be patient. The threshold is lower for comments - start there!\n\n### Asking About Height/Body\n\n* This rule covers SEVERAL AREAS. **Read fully.**\n\n* Do not ask users for information about their body they haven't already provided. \n\n* We cannot predict the future - don't ask us to! Don't ask when growing stopped for talls, how tall parents are, if your tall child is going to be a tall adult, etc.\n\n* Other height/body-related questions may also fit this rule without being explicitly stated.\n\n* And quit asking everyone about their feet. I think that's fetish bait. Don't answer!\n\n### Body-Negative Threads & Body Talk Flair\n\n* Regarding the Body Talk Flair! \n\n* It's okay to want to grumble about your body (tallness or otherwise). We ask you to do so in a way that doesn't make everyone else feel like you're also grumbling about all bodies. \n\n* Please do the following: \n\n> * Set Body Talk Flair. \n> * Spoiler your post. \n> * Omit negative descriptions & remarks from the **title.** \n\n* For an explanation of this rule [Follow the Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TallGirls/comments/vetntx/a_little_chat_about_our_bodies/)\n\n### Dating & Intimacy Content Limitations\n\n* This sub is for commiseration and camaraderie *among TallGirls*! \n\n* TallGirl to TallGirl Talk ONLY. See the first rule in this sub if you're confused. \n\n* TallGirls can vent about & discuss dating & relationships. Please keep things clean & "safe-for-work." \n\n* Content specifically seeking validation may be removed, especially if it borders into the "how to make a man like me" territory. \n\n* Content from minors may be removed. Sorry, kids. \n\n### Safe-For-Work, Profile, and History Rules\n\n* This is a SFW (Safe For Work) sub & a safe space for TallGirls of all ages (within the TOS of Reddit). \n\n* All posts, comments, gifs, links, & images should be SFW.\n\n* Profiles must be SFW. History in fetish & NSFW subreddits will result in a ban. Participation in quarantined subs may result in a ban. Links to off-site platforms that are NSFW may result in a ban. \n\n### No Self-Promo, Advertising, or Surveys\n\n* All promo content should go through modmail - most of it will be denied. The vast majority of requests are very off-topic.\n\n* This includes subversive promotion, i.e., having an account name as a brand while posting & commenting to ensure profile clicks/views. \n\n* Surveys of any kind are also inappropriate for the community at this time.\n\n### Saturday Selfies 🤳\n\n* Selfies can be posted on Saturdays. \n\n* Image posts require manual moderation, please be patient with your human moderators!\n\n* If you want to share images outside of Saturday they should not contain faces & bodies (i.e., you can post an outfit on a hanger, but not on you, sorry).\n\n* Selfies should be safe-for-work content only. Feel free to share outfit details in your post - let us know where you're shopping or what you're making. 💗\n\n### If You Are A Man\n\n* This space isn't for you. \n\n* Do not answer questions "as a man." \n\n* Do not post. \n\n* This rule has been simplified from earlier iterations b/c of confusion. If your behavior is unwanted or otherwise annoying you will be banned and the ban will not be eligible for appeal. \n\n---\n\n### Our Sister Sub!: r/Tall, featuring [Talls of the World Discord](https://discord.gg/gmrA5Ux)\n\n---\n\n### Related Subs:\n\n* r/tall\n* r/tallfashionadvice\n* r/TallMeetTall\n* r/BodyAcceptance	67599	2	2.2682833085852425	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:19:47.14601	2011-07-29 02:49:47-05	2025-03-14 01:19:47.1459-05

Save your complaints for your therapy session, 'cause here in our little corner of Reddit, we're all about the snark.\n\nNow, let's get back to regularly scheduled programming and unleashing our sardonic wit on those reality TV divas.\n\n**3.\nNEIGHBORLY RESPECT**\nListen up! No blabbering about other communities, content, users or MODS just to stir up trouble. We're not here to incite targeted harassment or abuse against others. Focus on the KJ’s damnit!\n\nCut the crap when it comes to sharing anything that encourages the harassment of users or other subs or you can expect a visit from the REDDIT ADMIN POLICE. This is THEIR rule and we follow and abide.\n\nSo, Zip those lips, hold your horses, and show a little respect for your neighbors.\n\n**4.\nHUSH HUSH, it's time to Go**\nWe know you're an amazing person with fascinating stories and insights, but you don't have to announce your departure like it's a grand exit from a Broadway show. We will miss you, but you can slip away peacefully and quietly.\n\nIf the content here isn’t your cup of tea or align with your interests, there's no need to create a five-paragraph essay outlining your unhappiness.

But here's the kicker- when a user declares they're "done," take a hint and back off.\n\nDon't be the pyromaniac, itching to ignite more chaos.

We ALLOW photos of the KarJenner children, courtesy of their parents, family members, and even media. But there's a catch!\n\nWe won’t tolerate any offensive thoughts, opinions, or comments directed at or about anyone under the age of 18.\n\nSave your critiques and judgments for the adults in their lives and when it comes to the littles, keep your comments respectful.\nKeep the drama focused on the grown-ups where it belongs!\n\n"Report" users that can't comprehend or follow the rules!\n\n**8.\nThe ILLUMINATI and TIN FOIL HATS**\nRumors are a part of life and we can tolerate doses and sprinklings of gossip. We draw the line at tinfoil hat-wearing, intergalactic government lizard people, kind of stories.\nThis ain't the place for that nonsense.\n\nWe are separating the Wheat from the Chaff!\nIf you want to make an outlandish claim, show us the money! Proof, evidence, sources, or legit links.\n\nEmbrace the weirdness of reality and leave the insane outlandish space lasers for eyeballs BS at the door.\n\n**9.\nNO DEADNAMING / Pronoun Abuse**\nListen up misinformed souls. NO Deadnaming!\nDeadnaming, is the art of using a transgender person's birth name (pronuns) instead of their chosen name. Even if you're talking about pretransition times, use the chosen name and correct pronouns.\n\nRespect Caitlyn's name and "She" / "Her" pronouns - even if you don’t respect her, respect the rule.\n\nWhen in doubt of what to use, use "THEY"/"THEM"\n\nWe don't allow discrimination, therefore this is not debatable. It's bigger than Caitlyn folks!\n\n**10.\n"ISM's" and "Differences"**\nAlright, you funky rebels! This one is as clear as a neon sign on a desert night. We aren’t down for any racism, homophobia, discrimination, or bigotry in this neck of the digital woods.\n\nSo keep your prejudice at the door and let's groove together in harmony. Embrace the kaleidoscope of humanity, and keep it civil because we celebrate every body here!\n\nIt's self explanatory, my friends! We're here to foster a community of diversity.\n\n"Report" those that can't comprehend, capiche?\n\n**11.\nPUFFY VAG, BDE and Personal Fantasies**\nWell folks, we are keepin’ this Sub on the righteous path, so this ain't the spot to flaunt your puffy vaginas, brag about your BDE, or dive into the realm of pornography.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, but we are keeping it somewhat decent!\n\nWe're here to delve into the world of KarJenner drama, not your personal fantasies. So, respect the boundaries, show some restraint.\n\nSexually explicit content will be swept away faster than you can say "orgasm."\n\n**12.\nLOW EFFORT**\nGet off that cushy ass of yours and put in some real work! We're not here for half-assed attempts. When you're posting those juicy links, don't leave us hanging in the dark. Give us some damn context!\n\nWe want to know what we're getting into, what scandalous treasure awaits us. Don't be a tease, spill the tea! This is the KarJenner's, where drama reigns supreme, and we deserve nothing less than your very best.\n\nNow, get out there, sweeties, and let the world witness your snarky brilliance.\n\n**13.\nPEACE be With You, and also with You**\nListen up, you rabble-rousers. If you revel in the art of quarrel, thrive on the thrill of attacking your fellow USERS, or the MODS, this haven of ours is not for you.\n\nWe relish a good debate, a fiery clash of opinions. We savor the bitter taste of cynicism as it dances on our tongues, but draw the line at personal attacks and vile rants.\n\nWe do not revel in the exposure of others' follies - Posting/commenting without removing the names on screenshots from other subs is strictly forbidden.\n\n**14.\nDOXXING (publishing personal information)**\nWe don't mess around with doxxing in this subreddit. Doxxing is the shady act of publishing someone's personal information or revealing their real identity without their consent. And guess what? We don't play that game here!\n\nRespect each other's privacy.

\N	xxs	XXS	**Welcome to the subreddit for people (all genders) who wear size XXS, 00, 000 or are generally just very tiny! This a place to discuss fashion, body acceptance and to support one another.**\n\nWHO IS SIZE XXS?\n\n* Anyone who considers themselves to be XXS is XXS! Easy as that. This subreddit is for all genders. A good way to know if you are size XXS is if either A) you own clothing that is that size or B) your relatives constantly tell you to eat more.\n\nWHAT IS SIZE XXS?\n\n* XXS is a clothing size that stands for extra-extra-small. It is different from the size Petite, which is for people 5'4" and under. The size XXS refers to weight rather than height. A person can be 5'7" and wear size XXS (or 00 or 000) jeans. Or a person can be 5'1" and wear size XXS! Basically, a person who wears XXS or 00/000 is very thin.\n* See J. Crew's [clothing size charts & measurements](https://www.jcrew.com/sizecharts/main.jsp) for more information.\n\nWHERE TO FIND SIZE XXS CLOTHING\n\n* Please see our [Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/XXS/wiki/index).\n\nSIMILAR SUBREDDITS\n\n* /r/ABraThatFits\n* /r/BodyAcceptance\n* /r/FemaleFashionAdvice\n* /r/MaleFashionAdvice\n* /r/PetiteFashionAdvice\n* /r/Short\n* /r/ShortFit\n* /r/ShortMen\n* /r/ShortTwoX\n* /r/ShortWomen\n\nIF /R/XXS WASN'T XXX ENOUGH FOR YOU (*NSFW*)\n\n* /r/Petite\n* /r/SkinnyLegs \n* /r/SlimGirls\n* /r/XSmallGirls \n* /r/XXSmall \n\nOTHER COMMUNITIES\n\n* /r/PlusSize\n\nRULES\n\n1. Be respectful and civil.\n2. No weight-shaming (this includes fat-shaming and [thin-shaming](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-oliver/skinny-shaming_b_3506313.html)).\n3. Any inappropriate or cruel comments will result in immediate ban.\n4.

\N	youniquepresenterms	YouniquePresenterMS	___\n# **RULES AT A GLANCE:**\n\n**1. Do not touch the poop.** \n&nbsp;\n\nDo not contact MS on social media and do not comment on her posts.\n\n**2. Remember why you're here: to snark.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAs a snark sub, we need to keep in mind to focus on one thing only: snarking. Our community is strictly for condescension. If you don't agree then we suggest unsubscribing.\n\n*Still disagree with this rule?* Both mods and members of the community believe that MS promotes skewed and prejudiced views, harmful rhetoric, false perceptions of body image, false health claims, and is constantly trying to use her influence to scam and take advantage of others.\n\n**3. Censor faces of everyone but MS.** \n&nbsp;\n\n\nFaces of children, innocent bystanders, frenemies, family members, and C must be blurred/censored.\n\n\n**4. Censor all names.** \n&nbsp;\n\n\nNames in screen shots must be censored--DO NOT ask for MS's full name or social media handles. This is doxxing.\n\n\n**5. No derogatory name calling.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- **NOT OK:** b-tch, sl-t, wh-re, c-nt, and the like.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- **OK:** jerk, jackass, ugly, gross, asshole, cretin, heathen, etc.\n\n\n**6. Examples of posts that will be removed:**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- "Open Letter" style posts or comments ("Hey, MS___.")\n&nbsp; \n- Links to TikTok posts\n&nbsp;\n- Instagram story infographics; [see this post for clarification](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouniquePresenterMS/comments/zn1qxr/clarification_on_modified_rules_helpful_info/)\n\n\n**7. No member policing/mini-modding.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMember-to-member comment policing will not be tolerated. Use the report function.\n\n\n**8. No sub-related META posts.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNo posts about the subreddit. If you can't handle the snark, sarcasm, and jokes (within the Reddit Content Policy), this sub may not be for you.\n\n\n**9. Moderators have full discretion.** \n&nbsp;\n\n\nPosts will be removed if seen fit by the mods. Do not argue with mods if your post/comment has been removed.\n\n\n**10. Please include the year on all old photos posted of MS to avoid confusion.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**11. No blogging.**\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNo need to go into details about why you do the same things as MS. We're here to snark on one person only so please refrain from going off topic or commenting about your work life or personal life nor is this the place. Bloggy comments will be deleted. \n\n\n**12. No leg humping.**\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce again, this is a snark sub. We are here to snark on the subject, not to praise her. You can be snarky/critical without resorting to overt compliments.\n\n\n\n### **See [Official Rule Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouniquePresenterMS/about/rules/) for Full List!**\n\n___\n**Other Related Subreddits:**\n\nr/IG_InfluencerTGFH - One of the influencers MS has pathetically copied and wants to be.\n\nr/SouthernHunsofIG - for all the other annoying scammy MLM huns you love to hate.\n___	18643	59	4.668309580246567	\N	\N	0	2025-03-14 01:19:44.665697	2020-02-05 07:02:48-06	2025-03-14 01:19:44.665595-05
